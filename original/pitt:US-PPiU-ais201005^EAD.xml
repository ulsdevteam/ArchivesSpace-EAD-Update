    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Joni Rabinowitz was born on July 30, 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. She grew up in New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City. Her father, Victor, a lawyer, represented trade unions and others whose unpopular ideas made finding legal representation difficult. Although her mother, Marcia, had advanced education, she remained a home maker and became a community activist who worked to integrate the public schools in New Rochelle. </p><p>In 1959 Rabinowitz graduated from New Rochelle High School and entered Antioch College, a liberal arts college located in Yellow Springs, Ohio, that offered "cooperative education programs where students alternate between on-campus study and off-campus work."  Having grown up playing the cello, she entered as a Music major, but by her senior year, she changed her major to Political Science. She was active in various left political causes during her college years, including a period in 1963 when she went to Albany, Georgia, to volunteer for voter registration work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).  This was part of her co-op experience at Antioch.  While in Georgia, she was arrested three times on the street for vagrancy (charges later dropped), and fasted in jail once for fifteen days and once for nine days. She was also charged with perjury by a federal grand jury and tried along with eight others as the "Albany Nine." Although she was convicted, the 5th Circuit Court eventually reversed the conviction.</p><p>In addition to civil rights, Rabinowitz while at Antioch was also active in Fair Play for Cuba (she helped organize a student trip to Cuba at Christmas time 1960), attended the Helsinki Youth Conference in 1961, and worked for peace, free speech and socialism. In 1964, along with over 100 other protestors, Rabinowitz was arrested for demonstrating against a Yellow Springs barber who would not serve African-American patrons. She completed her Bachelor of Arts degree at Antioch in 1965.</p><p>Rabinowitz completed one year of Social Work school at Adelphi University in New York. During this time, together with students from other social work schools in New York, she worked to support civil rights work in the South. In the summer of 1966, she worked with the California Migrant Ministry in the San Joaquin Valley as a community organizer among Mexican-American farm workers. After this experience, she returned to New York to take a job with the New York City Welfare Department, where she remained until 1969. She was also involved with the local Social Service Employees Union (SSEU), welfare rights, and opposition to the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Her SSEU involvement lead to her being arrested three times during a strike in 1968. The SSEU was independent, but eventually merged with District Council 31 of AFSCME (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers). Rabinowitz was also part of Movement for a Democratic Society (MDS), a local New York "grown up SDS" which had chapters in the welfare department, teachers, city planners and cab drivers.</p><p>While providing draft counseling for the union in New York, she met John Haer, who later became her husband. In 1969 they moved to Pittsburgh where his draft board had sent him to do alternative service at Mayview State Hospital, as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. </p><p>In the early 1970s Rabinowitz helped organize a 24 hour telephone hotline for youth, known as the "Switchboard," and wrote for and distributed an underground newspaper, the <title render="italic">Pittsburgh Fair Witness.</title>  Also during this period she worked with the Gulf Action Project and other groups around the country in anti-corporate campaigns.  In 1974 Rabinowitz earned a Masters of Social Work degree in community organizing from the University of Pittsburgh.</p><p>In 1971 she was a founding member of the New American Movement (NAM). This nationwide socialist-feminist organization promoted democratic socialism, feminism, economic democracy, anti-racism, labor unions, gay rights, anti-war actions, international solidarity, women's rights, civil rights, and utility reform. It aimed to create a broad movement for American socialism.  It also had an extensive education program, both internal and also for the public. Additionally, NAM sponsored cultural events, such as films and folk-singers and groups. In 1973 the Pittsburgh chapter produced a slide show, "Pittsburgh 1902, a People's History" and also created a People's History of Pittsburgh wall calendar for 1973.  In 1982 NAM merged with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) to form the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Rabinowitz was one of the minority of members, nationally, who opposed the merger.</p><p>Rabinowitz was a leader in both the local and Industrial Heartland Region organizations of NAM. Between 1971 and 1982, she was off-and-on again a Steering Committee member in the Pittsburgh Chapter, and also attended every annual national convention during those ten years. Along with her husband and several others in the Pittsburgh chapter, she was on the committee which published the <title render="italic">NAM Newsletter</title>, a monthly publication beginning in 1972, which was mailed to several hundred interested people. In 1982, after the merger, the name changed to the <title render="italic">Allegheny Socialist</title> and was published for several years after that. She was also involved in the Peoples Power Project, a NAM campaign for utility reform, from 1976-1980.  In 1974-1975 she worked through NAM on a City Budget Campaign, organized to get Pittsburgh City council to fund more human services.</p><p>Between 1979 and 1982, Rabinowitz managed Wobblie Joe's, a small bar on the South Side of Pittsburgh owned by some friends who hoped to bring together the mill-worker culture with the music of Appalachia.  The bar had live music every night -- at least two nationally-known figures got their start there: folk singer Anne Feeney and blues singer Ernie Hawkins.  Economic problems were the primary cause of the bar's closing in 1982.  Rabinowitz and the co-owners also had disagreements with the staff, which were solved by the staff forming a union.</p><p>In 1983 Rabinowitz took a job as a public policy advocate for the Hunger Action Coalition. Two years later the organization split and Rabinowitz helped found Just Harvest, an anti-hunger and anti-poverty advocacy organization. She remained as one of two co-directors at Just Harvest until 2010, when she retired.  During her 25 years at Just Harvest, she organized on the national, state and local level for public policies which benefit poor and hungry people.  These included food stamp policy, school meals, and welfare policies, among others. </p><p>Currently, Rabinowitz lives in Pittsburgh with her husband and two cats, Claudette and Tippy.  Since her retirement, her activities include volunteering at a cat shelter, being elected to her neighborhood board, gardening, and organizing against Marcellus Shale drilling.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>The Joni Rabinowitz Papers, which date from 1957 to 2008, document her personal life and constant involvement and devotion to social, political and economic justice issues.  Her papers trace her activism in college and the historic civil rights cases she was involved in, her activism in New York City, and her move to Pittsburgh where she helped found the local chapter of the New American Movement (NAM).  A majority of the collection documents her involvement in a number of leftist/socialist organizations like the NAM, Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), Voter REP, and the Rainbow Political Action Committee.  Devoted to bringing awareness to social and economic inequality, she  was involved in a number of movements and organizations regarding race, class, hunger, and welfare rights.  Her papers also demonstrate her political concerns and intellectual interests through literature she collected concerning issues and organizations that existed throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>  </scopecontent>

The series is divided into six subseries according to the functions, activities, projects, and interests of the organization.  Additional materials concerning NAM can be found in the separate collection held by the Archives Service Center: New American Movement, Pittsburgh Chapter Records, 1973-1982, AIS.1989.18.</p><p>Originally founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1971 as a result of the anti-war movement, NAM was established in an effort to build a "new left."  Shortly after, regional chapters were established throughout the country.  At its height, NAM had chapters in about 30 places (many of them being campuses) with about 5,000 members. It was supported by dues, fundraisers and donations.  The organization stressed the importance of "political work and mass organizing as a means for transformation" and worked to "develop programs that would unify working people and catalyze a large mass movement for socialism."  Classism, sexism, racism, imperialism, and capitalism were many of the issues the organization advocated against.  The organization was also concerned with a host of international issues concerning Spain, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and China.  As a founding member of the Pittsburgh chapter, part of the steering committee, and primary creator of the chapter newsletter, Rabinowitz was heavily involved and committed to the organization.  She also attended all of the national conventions.</p><p>In 1971, Rabinowitz helped found the Pittsburgh chapter.  The chapter initially committed itself to anti-war activities -- organizing panel discussions, demonstrations, and pickets.  In 1973 it helped fight for the impeachment of President Nixon. Due to the labor climate of the time, the organization eventually became heavily involved in workplace organizing, as well as social services and political education.  Within the NAM were a number of commissions, such as the Energy Commission, that in 1975 devoted a considerable amount of time to speaking against the energy industry and its impending rate hikes, which included Duquesne Light.  The Pennsylvania Alliance for Jobs and Energy (PAJE) is a result of this, an organization Rabinowitz helped start.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref26_527" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Internal Business</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1982" type="inclusive">1972-1982</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_51a7f4e20584e2e2f88e6de2576e78e8"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>This subseries, organized alphabetically, documents the organizational structure of NAM and its role within the scope of the national organization.

Organized alphabetically, the publications include general mailings sent to members of the local chapter which reported on the various happenings of the organization; the chapter newsletter, which Rabinowitz was instrumental in the creation and distribution of; and various leaflets announcing chapter meetings and events.  The collection originally included a substantial amount of national NAM materials like instructional guides for organizing and running chapters, the national newsletter <title render="italic">Moving

NAM projects that Rabinowitz was involved in.  Folders are organized alphabetically.  The People's History Project and The People's Power Project make up a large portion of this subseries.  The People's History Project was created in order to bring awareness to the region's labor history which resulted in the creation of a slideshow and people's history calendar.  The People's Power Project was created in reaction to the energy crisis and acted as a form of outreach in order to bring awareness to the issue and inspire greater public involvement.  In 1976 the People's Power Project testified at hearings for a Lifeline bill in order to push for energy rate restructuring.  Rabinowitz, an experienced fundraiser, was responsible for the creation of the advertising book included in this subseries.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref95_qfw"

and Content Notes</head><p>In 1982 the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee and the New American Movement merged to form the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a merger opposed by Rabinowitz.  Nonetheless, she was active in the DSA as a member of the national executive committee and she served as a Pittsburgh delegate at the 1983 DSA conference in New York City. The series includes organizational records, various publications, events, and committees and projects the organization was involved in.  The series is divided into four subseries which are organized alphabetically.  For further information on the DSA, please see the Robert Opie Shepherd Papers Relating to the Democratic Socialists of America, AIS.1990.21 held by the Archives Service Center.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref153_ilt" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Internal Business</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1982/1992" type="inclusive">1982-1992</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a2f8dd16aaa5ab1af119a9002a9922a5"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>This subseries documents the organizational structure of the DSA and includes by-laws, correspondence, financial records, and membership lists which are organized alphabetically.

Voter REP was a local affiliate of Project VOTE!, a national organization based in Washington, D.C.  Due to the related goals and relationship between the two organizations, many of the materials in this subseries are mixed.  </p><p>Formed in 1986, Voter REP was a nonprofit charitable and educational organization committed to registering voters and increasing the political participation of blacks, women, low-income areas, youth, and disabled peoples. Rabinowitz worked for Voter REP as a coordinator.  The organization was located in the offices of the Hunger Action Coalition and grew out of prior Pittsburgh organizations committed to voter registration like the Alliance for Voter Registration.  Materials include records pertaining to internal functions of the organization, volunteer recruitment, voter registration drives, newsletters, workshops, and press.  Also included are records pertaining to the organization's fight against welfare and unemployment offices who refused the entry of volunteers in order to register people, a fight which eventually led to court.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref249_of7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Accounting</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1986/1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate><container

(NRC), now the Rainbow Push Coalition, and The Rainbow Political Action Committee (Rainbow PAC). Arranged alphabetically, it includes meeting minutes, by-laws, mailing lists, and national NRC materials.  The Rainbow Coalition grew out of Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign.  The coalition  was and still is a national organization committed to social justice, civil rights and political activism.  It was founded in order to help support candidates for public office dedicated to improving the lives of the powerless.  Rabinowitz helped run the Rainbow PAC which functioned as a political action committee based on progressive politics and committed to social justice, democracy and solidarity.  Although the Rainbow PAC was inspired by the NRC, they remained unconnected to the National Rainbow Coalition and free from the rules of the NRC.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref281_ckt"

Materials are organized alphabetically and include the constitution and by-laws, board business, correspondence, events, newsletters and mailings. The organization was founded in 1980 in order to support progressive politics and the principles of the Democratic Party.  The club also held forums and discussions in order to help solve community problems.  Additionally, the club also worked to endorse and support candidates committed to the same principles established by the club, distributing voters guides before primaries and elections in order to help inform community members.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref307_b4b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Board Business</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2000/2007" type="inclusive">2000-2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_065c3425b07f9357bf27ec61c07eb3db" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_1bfe324a4cc7cd1ab8566c817bdd1f49" parent="aspace_065c3425b07f9357bf27ec61c07eb3db" type="folder">66</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref308_au4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campaign for Kerry, Edwards, and Hoeffel</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2004/2004" type="inclusive">2004</unitdate><container id="aspace_6a39b9f05da4e60c3440e60cff54be8d" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_5a97e08e0c4c5a4bbc4a1b711ea71beb" parent="aspace_6a39b9f05da4e60c3440e60cff54be8d" type="folder">67</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref309_uus" level="file"><did><unittitle>Constitution and By-Laws</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2006/2006" type="inclusive">2006</unitdate><container id="aspace_2a030814d72361c9dea91789b140d492" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_0fc8c866fcd8a29b21eecfd6cebf9d4c" parent="aspace_2a030814d72361c9dea91789b140d492" type="folder">68</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref310_3rw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2005/2008" type="inclusive">2005-2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_147ddc11dfdd385fb624e6d2c18e3b35" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_18d647000853e7192d558720975e7cec" parent="aspace_147ddc11dfdd385fb624e6d2c18e3b35" type="folder">69</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref311_ts0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Events</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1998/2007" type="inclusive">1998-2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd1f925631ca3745eb344cc199c4af8f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_2cd0d9f5145bac5543c316ff95300571" parent="aspace_cd1f925631ca3745eb344cc199c4af8f" type="folder">70</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref314_wpe" level="file"><did><unittitle>Meetings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2005/2005" type="inclusive">2005</unitdate><container id="aspace_81b422e6af96e0eafe5e879c445eef37" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_a4f2966f3c516308b0d3866dbcb673e4" parent="aspace_81b422e6af96e0eafe5e879c445eef37" type="folder">71</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref312_kul" level="file"><did><unittitle>Member Lists</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2004/2007" type="inclusive">2004-2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_11ad51700086d7d60cc7dd3e0755015e" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_49b5374a70969fda480f6053b6eb4b6c" parent="aspace_11ad51700086d7d60cc7dd3e0755015e" type="folder">72</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref313_a6s" level="file"><did><unittitle>Newsletters and Mailings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1985/2006" type="inclusive">1985-2006</unitdate><container id="aspace_80cb948ffb57baf6d5162e3565a96222" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_78679d04eecd80cad977507ae0c877b7" parent="aspace_80cb948ffb57baf6d5162e3565a96222" type="folder">73</container></did></c03></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref20_6lr" level="series"><did><unittitle>Topics and Organizations</unittitle><unitid>IV.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1963/1982" type="inclusive">1963-1982</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_863ad4e6f27402f9dbf7b804428197ad"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>Rabinowitz collected an array of materials that illustrate the social, political, and economic issues that she experienced  throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

oversize journals, <title render="italic">GROK</title> and the <title render="italic">Pittsburgh Fair Witness</title>, as well as the Pittsburgh and Wisconsin People's History Calendars.  The materials are organized alphabetically.  <title render="italic">GROK</title> started publication in the 1970s, publishing nine monthly issues before the title was changed to the <title render="italic">Pittsburgh Fair Witness</title>.  Rabinowitz wrote for and distributed the <title render="italic">Pittsburgh Fair Witness</title>.  The following editorial published in 1972 provides the papers statement of purpose: </p><p>"The Fair Witness is published by a non-profit collective and is dedicated to the worldwide movement of people to control themselves—the movement to break down the authoritarian systems of government that are denying us our basic freedoms, that are responsible for needless genocidal wars, the perpetration of minority discrimination, the pollution of our environment and our bodies, the high concentration of power among the wealthy classes, exploitation of the individual, etc. The paper is dedicated to the struggle of all peoples to gain back the right to their own lives, the struggle to raise the consciousness of the world as a whole, the struggle to become independently productive through a working knowledge of the tools at our disposal. As a local paper our most important function concerns the movement here in western Pennsylvania."  </p><p>Rabinowitz helped create the Pittsburgh People's History Calendar which was produced by NAM's People's History Project. Records concerning the creation of the calendar can be found in the NAM series and "projects" subseries.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref465_sc1" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">GROK</title> Vol. 1 No. 3-9 (missing No. 7)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1970" type="inclusive">1970</unitdate><container id="aspace_13b0ecc6958e9315616146c1693c295a" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_747cc95692a7782f22e133b4f811080c" parent="aspace_13b0ecc6958e9315616146c1693c295a" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref466_u29" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">The Pittsburgh Fair Witness </title>Vol. 1 No. 10-11</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1970" type="inclusive">1970</unitdate><container id="aspace_ce5ee2a0a36d5b4f6c210350ed783f36" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_336448c7c529da0134c16c26f0b3087e" parent="aspace_ce5ee2a0a36d5b4f6c210350ed783f36" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref467_6dl" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">The Pittsburgh Fair Witness </title>Vol. 2 No. 1-7 (missing No.2)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1971" type="inclusive">1971</unitdate><container id="aspace_d7439041f54748e179847ec7aa927d8c" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_7b726841723a079d357833c32aca70a5" parent="aspace_d7439041f54748e179847ec7aa927d8c" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref468_vy3" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">The Pittsburgh Fair Witness</title> Vol. 2 No. 10-14</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1972" type="inclusive">1971-1972</unitdate><container id="aspace_3692c3457924320aef0d83504e1137ff" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_7a9063a0011b2cb7748afd7048239b93" parent="aspace_3692c3457924320aef0d83504e1137ff" type="folder">4</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref469_6w1" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">The Pittsburgh Fair Witness</title> Vol. 3 No. 2-8 (missing No. 7)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1972" type="inclusive">1972</unitdate><container id="aspace_68859e37ed7d04d0b2c88d9636a51f68" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_1595c3b9332c21121108fc2f0ab0ad4c" parent="aspace_68859e37ed7d04d0b2c88d9636a51f68" type="folder">5</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref470_sgo" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">The Pittsburgh Fair Witness</title> Vol. 3 No. 11-16</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1972" type="inclusive">1972</unitdate><container id="aspace_bcc3b04af7826b93f8aa44d396079ca8" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_6c2ee3a7504f968be41ac7ec87566381" parent="aspace_bcc3b04af7826b93f8aa44d396079ca8" type="folder">6</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref471_u2y" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">The Pittsburgh Fair Witness </title>Vol. 3 No. 17-20 and Vol. 4 No. 4-5</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1973" type="inclusive">1972-1973</unitdate><container id="aspace_efcbd387deb867b0a0f9bbd53f6ce096" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_921d1bcb024166f419d81ffdcecb2c02" parent="aspace_efcbd387deb867b0a0f9bbd53f6ce096" type="folder">7</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref472_jov" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pittsburgh People's History Calendar</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_539e4fe376ca075818ed5c03762a3b16" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_4b661a71024f97e98cb38cd67364e8f7" parent="aspace_539e4fe376ca075818ed5c03762a3b16" type="folder">8</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref473_c1q" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wisconsin People's History Calendar</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_7f9804a528dd04d5eea7918790097e17" label="Mixed Materials" type="oversize">9</container><container id="aspace_2d7d002a5ffb79101d51cdbcd1ad5d81" parent="aspace_7f9804a528dd04d5eea7918790097e17" type="folder">9</container></did></c03></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref22_yi5" level="series"><did><unittitle>Personal</unittitle><unitid>VI.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/2004" type="inclusive">1961-2004</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2b114ffca8601d60d637155308869c6f"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>This series contains materials that document Rabinowitz's experiences during college and after in New York City, non NAM and DSA affiliated conferences and events, legal cases she was involved in, writings and correspondence, various projects, and involvement in other various organizations.

Most of the articles are about civil rights struggles, especially in Georgia, where Rabinowitz worked with the SNCC in 1963. Other topics such as the March on Washington and Cuba and the students who broke the travel ban to visit are included in the clippings. Many of the articles mention Rabinowitz for her involvement in civil rights demonstrations and her arrests. There are also a few articles that she wrote about her experiences.

Materials are organized in chronological order. Of interest are the The Gegner v. McKee and Rabinowitz v. The United States cases.  Joni Rabinowitz v. The United States, or "Joni's Case" as it was known, involved she and five other members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) who were indicted for perjury in 1963 when she testified that she was not present at a protest meeting in front of an Albany, Ga., grocery store.  Her father, Victor Rabinowitz, defended her and won an appeal the next year.  The Gegner v. McKee involved Rabinowitz and over one hundred Antioch College students and other civil rights activists who were arrested in 1964 after protesting against Lewis Gegner, a Yellow Springs barber who refused to serve African American patrons.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref499_o0e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Albany By: Howard Zinn</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1962/1962" type="inclusive">1962</unitdate><container id="aspace_5f14b4b47561da2c2d61a6db4fba703f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">10</container><container id="aspace_28dae714acfd5f04e36edabce99d6f28" parent="aspace_5f14b4b47561da2c2d61a6db4fba703f" type="folder">23</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref500_jgo" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Albany Cases (pamphlet)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1962/1962" type="inclusive">1962</unitdate><container id="aspace_1c67be080eaf77026e7602fbd8ca8924" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">10</container><container id="aspace_b48ea5928db2eaf98eaa6b279c59aca5" parent="aspace_1c67be080eaf77026e7602fbd8ca8924" type="folder">24</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref505_5zj" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Joni's Case"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1963/1965" type="inclusive">1963-1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_3bf7ca86fc8aaf798a699c4176a04e89" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">10</container><container id="aspace_cbee6fc88ac45072a250349df18f09a2" parent="aspace_3bf7ca86fc8aaf798a699c4176a04e89" type="folder">25-26</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref506_rg0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Joni Rabinowitz v.
