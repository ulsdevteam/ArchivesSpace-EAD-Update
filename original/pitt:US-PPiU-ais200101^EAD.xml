    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Marilyn Skolnick was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1925. While in New York, she received her bachelor's degree in Geology at Brooklyn College, the University of the City of New York. Skolnick later received a master's degree in Anthropology from the University of Oklahoma and participated in additional post-graduate work at the State University of Iowa and the University of Texas. By 1998, Skolnick was listed in Marquis' <title render="italic">Who's Who of American Women.</title> </p><p>Skolnick began her career as an environmental and transportation activist when she moved to Houston, Texas, earlier in her life. The cause for her move was a job transfer on behalf of her husband, Herbert, at the Gulf Oil Corporation. Upon her arrival, the city of Houston had no public transportation system. On behalf of the Houston League of Women Voters, Skolnick advocated for one. In return for her transportation advocacy, the Houston mayor appointed Skolnick to a transit liaison committee. Unfortunately, she had little time to serve on this committee as her husband was transferred to Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1971. </p><p>Upon her arrival in Monroeville, Pa., Skolnick continued pursuing her interests in transportation issues. Beginning in 1971, she acted as an advocate for public transportation. She was able to do this through her active participation in the League of Women Voters as an observer to the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission. In particular, Skolnick focused on issues relating to the Pittsburgh and Allegheny County region. </p><p>Skolnick can be considered an avid environmentalist. This can be seen in her participation in organizations such as the Sierra Club, the Group Against Smog and Pollution (GASP), the Allegheny County Health Department, the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission, the Allegheny County Transit Council, and the Division of Air Quality. In addition to her participation in these environmental organizations, Skolnick was also an ardent reporter for causes related to air quality, hazardous waste, land use, clean water, and recycling. In relation to her desire to report, Skolnick hosted and produced a local Pittsburgh television show, "Focus on Issue." It was not uncommon for her to compose several articles in issues for the <title render="italic">Allegheny Sierran</title> (the newsletter of the Allegheny Group of the Sierra Club) i.e., "Is There a Maglev in Our Future?"</p><p>Skolnick was able to remain close to the causes by chairing various committees on air quality, conservation, and transportation. Her constant public involvement allowed for her to push for change in the areas of environment and transportation that she saw as necessary. Skolnick was president of the League of Women Voters in Monroeville from 1973 to 1975, and director of the League of Women Voters Pennsylvania from 1977 to 1985. Skolnick served as both a board member and Consumer Relations Chair for the Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT). She served a a member of the Executive Committee (Excomm) for the Sierra Club as well as the chair of Transportation and Growth Management. She also served on committees and as chairperson for organizations such as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, Small Business Assistance Program, the Transportation Research Board, Allegheny County Hazardous Waste Task Force, and the Monroeville Planning Commission.</p><p>Marilyn Skolnick was the recipient of numerous awards for her contributions in the environmental and transportation arenas. These awards include a Certificate of Recognition from J.C. Penny Golden Rule Award, the American Bar Association's Liberty Bell Award, YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh's "A Tribute to Women for Leadership in Community Service," Woman of the Year by the Monroeville Jaycees, Citizen of the Year by the Monroeville Times-Express, and the National Sierra Club Environmental Hero for Transportation. In addition, in 2002, Marilyn Skolnick was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Brooklyn College Alumni Association.</p><p>Marilyn Skolnick resided in Monroeville until her death in December 2016.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>These papers document the efforts of Marilyn Skolnick to change the face of Pennsylvania transportation systems, mainly in the Pittsburgh, Allegheny County region. With a strong backing in environmentalism, Skolnick focused on changing transportation for the benefit of the environment and for the benefit of those in the community. Much of the materials contained in this collection come from Skolnick's participation in organizations and committees attempting to participate on behalf of the public for change. The collection mainly focuses on Skolnick's public involvement in the environmental and transportation spectrum and little on her life aside from these two issues.</p>  </scopecontent>

Some of these environmental issues (air quality, land use, pollution, transportation, waste, water) are aligned with the transportation cause. However, Skolnick was interested in numerous other issues (Chambers Landfill Company, chemicals, recycling, urban development, wetlands, wildlife) which demonstrate her environmental interests beyond transportation and can been seen by her membership in the Sierra Club. </p><p>Much of the material organized in this series was removed from the collection since it is published material and can be found elsewhere. This material included copies of U.S. Senate and U.S. House legislation on the subject of Growth Management, annual reports on air quality and air pollution rates for the Allegheny County reports and publications from the "Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center," the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the General Accounting Office (GAO). In relation to the Chambers Landfill Company, removals included reproductions of briefs, copies of resolutions and annual reports, reproduced records, waste management plans, and Pennsylvania Planning Codes. </p><p>This series date from 1970 to 2002 and is arranged in twenty-seven subseries, alphabetically, by environmental issue.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref27_rdi"

transportation issues and her aim to change transportation through all possible routes. She acted through standing committees at the Port Authority of Allegheny County (PAT), the Allegheny County Transit Council (ACTC), American Public Transit Association (APTA), the Transportation Research Board (TRB), Citizens Against New Toll Roads (CANTA), and the Monroeville Planning Commission. Skolnick's participation in each of these organizations and committees was relevant to the alterations she made in the Pittsburgh transportation system. This series has a wealth of information regarding Skolnick's time as a board member of PAT. In addition, Skolnick was heavily involved with the controversy over the construction of the Mon/Fayette Highway. </p><p>This series originally contained many bound publications. A large number of these publications were in relation to the Mon/Fayette Highway in Monroeville, Pa. These publications included, but were not limited to, alternative analysis, environmental impact statements, and progress reports. Other removals include research records from the Transportation Research Board. These include journals on the subjects of traffic patterns, transit systems, handicap access, and highway management improvement. In addition, Marilyn Skolnick had collected a large number of copies of transportation laws, as well as numerous copies of U.S. Senate and House Bills relating to transportation issues (ex. SB 528). </p><p>This series is divided into thirteen subseries, which arranged by subject. The material in this series date from 1961 to 2004.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref1071_80x" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Allegheny County Transit

id="aspace_4f24f7fbf4875952d221eacba6bf4fb2"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>The Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission (SPRPC) was formed in 1962 directly under provisions of the Planning Act. Years later, in 1992, membership in SPRPC combined with Fayette, Greene, and Indiana counties, molded the council to act as a Local Development District (LDD). This was done under the ARC Act of 1995. Also in 1995, the organization formed an Economic Development District (EDD) under the Public Works Act. In 1999, the SPRPC and the Council merged to form the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (SPC). </p><p>The members of the SPC include the counties of: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Washington, Westmoreland, and the City of Pittsburgh. SPC is the Pennsylvania's region for "collaboration, planning, and public decision-making. SPC is responsible for planning and prioritizing the use of all state and federal transportation funds allocated to the region" (SPC website). Since ten counties are involved in the SPC, the decisions made on any issue have the power to affect each participating county. </p><p>Due to her interest in the Pennsylvania transportation cause, Marilyn Skolnick was involved in the SPRPC and participated in many of its committees; in particular, she served as a member of the Transportation Plan Policy Committee for the Long Range Transportation Plan. This series originally contained publications concerning SPC/SPRPC drafts and final reports regarding transportation improvement programs that were duplications of other documents or available elsewhere. </p><p>This series is organized into  three subseries, alphabetically, by committee.The material in this series date from 1979 to 2005.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref2161_4zs"

it was this involvement that allowed her to push for change in the transportation spectrum early in her life. She did this through membership in the League of Women Voters in both Texas and Pennsylvania. During her participation in the League of Women Voters, Skolnick encouraged informed and active participation of Pennsylvania citizens. In the government realm, Marilyn used this organization to increase the understanding of major public policy. </p><p>Not only was she Vice President and Director of the League of Women Voters, but Skolnick was also heavily involved in the Sierra Club in Allegheny County. The Sierra Club is America's oldest, largest, and most influential grassroots environmental organization. Marilyn served as Executive Director of the Allegheny County Chapter. Through memorandums, newsletters, conference notes, correspondence, agendas, minutes, organization literature, and studies, this series helps to provide insight into Skolnick's environmentalist background. </p><p>This series originally contained some published books on environmental issues, as well as environmental statues and legislation that are readily available elsewhere. </p><p>This series is organized into three subseries, arranged alphabetically, by organization. The material in this series date from 1977-2002.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref2359_y62" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Better Business Bureau</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate

concerning environmental and transportation issues throughout Pennsylvania. In order for Skolnick to best address these issues, she became involved with candidates during election periods to interview them on their views on these pressing topics. In addition to her active involvement on governmental affairs and elections, Skolnick was also interested in campaigning for peace. She did this by participating in the Peace Links organization. This series mainly addresses candidates' opinions on transportation, environmental, and labor affairs in the state of Pennsylvania; and Marilyn Skolnick's involvement with the Peace Links campaign.

of local and national events and trends concerning environmentalism, transportation, and the intersection of the two subjects. As such, she amassed a large amount of audio-visual material dealing with these issues. The material in the series includes primarily video cassettes, many of which are compilation tapes of news reports and local area meetings. There are also audio cassettes of Transportation Research Board meetings. The Audio-Visual Material series dates from 1987 to 2009 and is further divided into two subseries.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref2917_yek" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>VHS Tapes</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1987/2009" type="inclusive">1987-2009</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_15686aa8cee052d2e9967a1acd402299"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>The VHS Tapes subseries is arranged chronologically and dates from 1987 to 2009, with additional undated material.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref2919_7ti" level="item"><did><unittitle>1987 primary election;
