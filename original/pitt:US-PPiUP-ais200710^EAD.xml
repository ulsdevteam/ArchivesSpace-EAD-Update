Waldman first joined Thornburgh in 1971 when Thornburgh was serving as United States Attorney for Western Pennsylvania, later went with him to Washington, D.C. to the Criminal Division at the United States Department of Justice, and subsequently returned to Pennsylvania with Thornburgh in 1977 to manage his successful Campaign for Governor. He then served as the Executive Assistant to the Governor and General Counsel until 1986 when he returned to the private practice of law in Philadelphia. The collection includes material such as correspondence, memoranda, issue research and polling, news clips, and legal case documents.</abstract>

    <head>Biography</head>
<p>The Jay C. Waldman Papers document the fifteen years that he served as a close aide to Dick Thornburgh in his political career in the U.S. Department of Justice and as Pennsylvania Governor. As advisor to Thornburgh, Waldman also played a pivotal role in Pennsylvania government. Thornburgh's dedication to Waldman in his autobiography, <title>Where the Evidence Leads</title>, describes the relationship best: "To my friend, colleague and mentor."</p><p>Waldman graduated from University of Wisconsin in 1966, where he received honors in History and Political Science, and from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1969. Following law school, he served as law clerk to Pittsburgh Judge Gwilym A. Price, Jr. and briefly was an associate at Rose, Schmidt &amp; Dixon in Pittsburgh. </p><p>Waldman became known early on for his keen intellect and insights and accordingly served in major roles throughout Thornburgh's years of public service. In May 1971, Waldman first joined Thornburgh, then U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania. When Thornburgh moved on to serve as Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., Waldman accompanied him and served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General responsible for the Division's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, and Public Integrity Section, as well as the management of litigation for these operations from July 1975 to 1977. </p><p>Thornburgh returned to Pittsburgh to run for Governor in 1977; Waldman soon joined him and served as his Campaign Manager. Waldman's winning 1978 campaign strategies proved to be exceptional, particularly as Waldman had never run a campaign before. He subsequently served as executive assistant and legal counsel during Thornburgh's years as Governor of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1986. The Spring 2004 issue of the "Penn Journal" said, "Those who had the good fortune to know and work with Judge Waldman during these years, witnessed the workings of a brilliant political mind." After leaving the Thornburgh Administration, Waldman practiced law in Philadelphia and was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 1988, serving on the federal bench for 14 years. At the time of his death in 2003, it was expected that he would be elevated to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>The material in this collection reflects the expansive responsibilities Waldman amassed in his fifteen years of service as an aide to Dick Thornburgh. In addition to his native ability and advice, it is well known and documented that Waldman and Thornburgh not only worked well together, but also respected and admired one another. Waldman's collection and that of Dick Thornburgh's are significantly linked together, as many topics and issues are specifically intertwined. The collection contains correspondence, memoranda, issues, research and polling, news clippings, and legal case documents. The majority of the materials in this collection date from 1968 to 2003.</p><p>Waldman's contributions in each of his fifteen years of public service are reflected in these personal papers. However, as one who did not commit much to paper, the files are diverse and thin in some respects. They do reflect Waldman's expansive responsibilities in each position and the issues addressed. Waldman's ideas are particularly well represented in his memoranda during the first campaign for governor (1977-1978) and in reports and memoranda to Dick Thornburgh in Department of Justice years.</p><p>Waldman's official files from his gubernatorial years (1979-1986) are held by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission as part of the Dick Thornburgh Governor files: collection MC-404. Waldman's, as Executive Assistant and General Counsel, are within that collection: 4-2825.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The Waldman files came from his office and home following his untimely death in 2003. They were collected, boxed and ultimately kindly donated to the University of Pittsburgh by his wife, Roberta Waldman. Some files and papers were loose in boxes, some foldered, many not. Where Waldman had assorted folders in large accordion files or others titled specifically by him, that order has been maintained.</p>  </custodhist>

One of those subsequently hired was Jay C. Waldman. Unbeknownst at that time to either Thornburgh or Waldman, the latter was to serve a major role in Thornburgh's ongoing public career. Waldman continued in the U.S. Attorney's office until 1975 when he moved to Washington D.C., joining Thornburgh who had been named Deputy Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.

Waldman began as Special Assistant to Thornburgh and was promoted to Deputy Assistant Attorney General with responsibility for overseeing organized crime, official corruption, and narcotics matters within the department and the U.S. Attorneys' offices. Waldman briefly continued in this position after March 1977 when Thornburgh returned to Pennsylvania. He then resigned on July 15th after working for those few months under Pete Flaherty, who was Thornburgh successor at the Department of Justice as Deputy Attorney General. The material in this series includes memos, correspondence, organization charts, case research, speeches, and departmental issues. This series is further subdivided into five subseries: Waldman/Thornburgh Files, Departmental Reorganization, Strike Forces, Cases/Issues, and Department Files. The dates here are from 1974 to 1977. Additional relevant research files can be found in the Dick Thornburgh Papers housed at the Archives Service Center.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref82_26g" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Waldman/Thornburgh Files</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1977" type="inclusive">1975-1977</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4e78959dbf4916af40f803b1c112fdb6"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>The memoranda contained in this subseries served as the principal method of communication within the division regarding department personnel, cases, and legal investigations.

top-to-bottom review of the division's management structure at the very outset of their arrival in Washington in 1975. This ultimately resulted in wide-spread and often especially difficult personnel changes, including the replacement or reassignment of most deputies and section chiefs. Additionally, a Public Integrity Section was created, which was a major contribution to accomplishments of the tenure of Thornburgh and Waldman. Related research, correspondence, drafts and comprehensive reports in this subseries enumerate the complexities associated with this reorganization and include the final report to Attorney General Griffin Bell. The material in this subseries dates from 1975 to 1977.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref99_bje" level="file"><did><unittitle>JCW handwritten notes, personnel and organization</unittitle><unitdate

organized crime "Strike Forces." Waldman had experience with the Strike Forces and related controversies from his years with Thornburgh in the U.S. Attorney's office in Pittsburgh. There was pressure in the Criminal Division to integrate them into the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, with Waldman in charge of organized crime and related issues. The future of the "Strike Forces" was only decided in the fall of 1976. What ensued was an office-by-office appraisal of the various strike forces which is well documented in this material. Some strike forces were disbanded, others "folded in" to U.S. Attorneys' offices, and some kept in operation but under much stricter guidelines which are enumerated in a December 1976 report. The materials date from 1976 to 1977.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref116_272" level="file"><did><unittitle>Guidelines</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">August-September 1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_b1970c2503d60a3fc488a8df480a0058" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_d44f76511e0ef5d5d3909e2382debb41" parent="aspace_b1970c2503d60a3fc488a8df480a0058" type="folder">30</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref117_ron" level="file"><did><unittitle>Guidelines</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">October-November 1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb599c4650033ceea30ef2db1ed195c4" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_06c6d85eab38fb466f7500c3aa3630f9" parent="aspace_eb599c4650033ceea30ef2db1ed195c4" type="folder">31</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref118_7wt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Guidelines</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">December 1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_83984ad3de77f7a1df8eed55153c9501" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_5fd0b8eeafe11056ae7690c1e1248f65" parent="aspace_83984ad3de77f7a1df8eed55153c9501" type="folder">32</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref119_iux" level="file"><did><unittitle>Organized Crime Program</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">December 1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_0993a6096997e2c7b19aecd95c560278" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_92cccfaae14a56fd7a37fbdfe7d9d498" parent="aspace_0993a6096997e2c7b19aecd95c560278" type="folder">33</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref120_ny4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence and reports</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">January-March 1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_7011dc1afda2a4b848b9e6ebdc2a5ef2" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_778b5c825bee2ded107cd29ebb7a5fb5" parent="aspace_7011dc1afda2a4b848b9e6ebdc2a5ef2" type="folder">34</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref121_4wu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evaluations</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">May-August 1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_b14655a7d418c3c9153071377e49c9aa" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_799550d0c231a543d9439144d38723c8" parent="aspace_b14655a7d418c3c9153071377e49c9aa" type="folder">35</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref122_f8e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evaluations, New York, Connolly Issue</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_778e937bf6fbc9b51b22686b5448d3d0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_797b5e626fa946cccb0cd9875b58551a" parent="aspace_778e937bf6fbc9b51b22686b5448d3d0" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref123_fb9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evaluations, New York, Connolly Issue</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_2bb50a77ca26a98920670a0ff6e43b69" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_be3b94043e993f08427772da860b0787" parent="aspace_2bb50a77ca26a98920670a0ff6e43b69" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref124_z7n" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evaluations, Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, Los Angeles</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_108bb76136a952d04997ac939f22db07" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_9ce5ac7910f494ae8acd2820d2b9cd92" parent="aspace_108bb76136a952d04997ac939f22db07" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref125_5lc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evaluations, Newark, Detroit</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_4eb332410e5a2d387879d8af23ee2788" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_b59b516c62c6baf18b8d915beec08b77" parent="aspace_4eb332410e5a2d387879d8af23ee2788" type="folder">4</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref126_0in" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evaluations, New Orleans, St. Louis</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_0f7502220d1ab6eabbc0e3f1c3dc01ff" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_227556a0536436bb05ebae650e88f57c" parent="aspace_0f7502220d1ab6eabbc0e3f1c3dc01ff" type="folder">5</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref128_pl8" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Cases/Issues</unittitle><unitid>4.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1977" type="inclusive">1975-1977</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e8078cb01d6cb5adceb5feac020fec29"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>These files specifically relate to cases handled by the Criminal Division.

consultants seeking to represent and guide the Dick Thornburgh campaign for governor. Many were submitted spontaneously and in fact more than one consultant was used. Lance Tarrence provided much information, and David Garth was contracted for the primary election. Roger Ailes and Bailey/Deardourff were used in the general election. The plans are very detailed, many highly statistical, and frequently included polls/questionnaires to determine and convey potential outcomes. These were relevant not only regarding voters' attitudes about candidates, but also for identifying issues of concern to the voters.</p><p>Since Waldman, the designated campaign manager, had never run a campaign before, he carefully reviewed each consultant's suggestions. Waldman's own memoranda ultimately spell out the actual path of the campaign. The extensive Tarrance volumes were actually bound as books and have been maintained in that form.

Knowing opponents' past records, and current platform and actions can be a critical determinant in an election. The depth of material prepared and accumulated by the Thornburgh campaign staff is a testament to the thoroughness of campaign research and where "no surprises" was a mantra. It was prudent also to be knowledgeable about the primary Democratic candidates, not knowing which would be Thornburgh's opposition in a general election should he win the primary. There are clippings for each candidate, candidate assessments, plus biographical material both for Republicans and Democrats. This series is further divided into three subseries: Primary Candidates, General Election Candidate Assessments, and General Election Candidate News Clippings. The materials date from 1974 to 1978. Additional and significant material about the candidates can be found in the Dick Thornburgh Papers.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref185_ztw" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Primary Election Candidates</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1977/1978" type="inclusive">1977-1978</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1155080d0cab625985557ccfd37ed98f"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>In the primary election Thornburgh was opposed by six Republican candidates, he being the only "western" candidate. This comparatively large number of candidates divided the votes considerably, and the balance between east and west candidates became a significant factor. Additionally, it is fair to say that of all the candidates in both parties, Thornburgh was perhaps the least well known across the Commonwealth. On the Democrat side, there were several candidates, again with one from Western Pennsylvania, Pete Flaherty, Pittsburgh's former Mayor. There are some preliminary "how to" files, and then the candidates are listed alphabetically, first Democrats (D) and then Republicans (R). The majority of the material in this subseries dates from 1977 to 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref186_jsq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Opposition Research Guidelines prepared by Republican National Committee</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_d6a9651fdc72fd5366e015b542c64f0f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">7</container><container id="aspace_7d1fa037e9faaaf699de999172b195e5" parent="aspace_d6a9651fdc72fd5366e015b542c64f0f" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref187_39n" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lieutenant Governor candidates, Republican and Democrat</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_c6d4044ef9d365aa1580a5aff71c685a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">7</container><container id="aspace_a10ec802277af07d49e3417b31c21c4c" parent="aspace_c6d4044ef9d365aa1580a5aff71c685a" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref188_x59" level="file"><did><unittitle>News Digests about Republican and Democrat candidates for Governor</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">April 1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_485a2280143af16ea91839cc001a789b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">7</container><container id="aspace_de58bc85be2cfda52dc650052618bec6" parent="aspace_485a2280143af16ea91839cc001a789b" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref189_i14" level="file"><did><unittitle>Robert P.

In the General Election the opposition research focused on the two principal Democrat candidates: Pete Flaherty for Governor and Robert Casey for Lieutenant Governor. That Flaherty and Casey were both from Pittsburgh presented an unusual circumstance, with Thornburgh also a Pittsburgher. Flaherty had the reputation of being a successful former Mayor of Pittsburgh and previously had run an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate. Thornburgh, on the other hand, was little known outside Western Pennsylvania. Casey became the Democrat Lieutenant Governor candidate due to the coincidence of having precisely the same name (Robert P. Casey) as the former auditor general of Pennsylvania who was a gubernatorial candidate in the Primary. Running among fifteen lesser known persons, the "wrong Bob Casey" was selected, having no political or public service experience whatsoever. On the Republican side, William W. Scranton III, son of the well known and much admired former Governor, became the choice for Lieutenant Governor and actively participated in the campaign. Candidate research included Scranton as well as the Democrats since Thornburgh needed to know the background and issues important to his potential Lieutenant Governor. The major research focused on Flaherty and the background topics are those from a binder distributed to campaign staff. The Dick Thornburgh Papers contain much relevant information to this series. The materials in this subseries date from 1955 to 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref222_qbl" level="file"><did><unittitle>William W.

and are separated by candidate and month in the original order that they were prepared and distributed to campaign staff. There are very few clippings for Robert P. Casey since he had been told by the Pete Flaherty campaign to stay teaching rather than complicate the campaign as he did the first few times he appeared with undesirable results. Ultimately it was telling that the students at his school endorsed William W. Scranton. To appreciate the specific status of the campaign, similarly dated clippings from each candidate could be reviewed and compared. There are very few articles from early November, since election day was November 7, and clippings and candidate comments were no longer useful. The material dates from May to early November 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref244_wyi" level="file"><did><unittitle>Scranton</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">May-June

Thornburgh and Waldman focused on the necessity of finding precisely the right person to lead and develop issue substance. They found this in Rick Stafford, who put together staff and drew on multitudes of volunteers with expertise in varying areas of government. An issue binder was put together of all topics, carefully outlined, and a virtual library of resources brought to the campaign. Overall issues were easy to identify, but polls further honed those of particular concern to voters. Potholes and corruption were two highlighted. There is considerable issue documentation here both in the Waldman and Dick Thornburgh Papers. Waldman's "R&amp;I" (research and issues) files are included in the topics in this series. It is important to note that there is not much research material by the Flaherty campaign, either primary or general election. Flaherty depended on his appealing persona and distance from discredited Shapp Democrats to win. Thornburgh in contrast, with Waldman's overall campaign leadership, successfully presented a solid platform derived from facts and knowledge to persuade the voters. The materials in this series date are from 1966 to 1978.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref264_7hd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campaign Research Techniques</unittitle><unitdate

Waldman, Campaign Manager, had never before run a campaign, his strategy was followed meticulously by candidate Dick Thornburgh and aided by significant research on both issues and other candidates. Memoranda from Jay Waldman to Dick Thornburgh were pivotal. They discuss the initial feasibility of and tasks related to a possible campaign for governor. They then lay a foundation that was key to the ultimate success of both the primary and general election campaigns. There is no better way to understand this campaign than to read the memoranda primarily to and from Jay Waldman and Dick Thornburgh. Although Waldman's own specifically labeled materials are a bit thin in quantity they document the campaign progress, and ultimate success, due in large measure to Waldman's inspired leadership. This series is further divided into five subseries: Jay C. Waldman Files, Dick Thornburgh Files, GOP, County Files, and Campaign in Progress (CIP).</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref287_09k" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Jay C.

The files document careful research about campaigns by Waldman. Waldman as manager guided and led and, therefore, did not leave as much paper documentation of his own. The staff and field organizers carried out the plans and left most of the research documentation. Waldman's other files are somewhat miscellaneous in character and thin given the overall strategy and organization. The handwritten notes are an indication of the extent of his contacts and information gathering from multiple sources, particularly via telephone conversations. Waldman's files are grouped as follows: memoranda, personal calendar, news clippings ("clippings"), correspondence, handwritten notes, "miscellaneous 1977," telephone logs, "people," polls, and "research." The materials in quotations are Waldman's own subject headings in original order. The files in this subseries date from 1976 to 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref288_2f9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memoranda</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">March-July

campaign. The majority of the material is from 1977. By then the candidate was constantly on the trail, as the schedules included in the collection specifically indicate. This subseries contains both memos and correspondence to and from Dick Thornburgh. Many of the early memos are "To File" and represent the candidate's experiences on the campaign trail, contacts, and suggestions that might be useful to staff as the campaign proceeded. These were a primary tool in the effective communications between the candidate and Waldman in particular. The Thornburgh correspondence is from early in the campaign (1977) and in many cases responding to offers of help, especially from persons he knew or met on the campaign trail. News clippings (clippings) and magazine articles track the candidate as his name and positions became increasingly known and effective. Files are arranged as follows: memoranda, articles pre-campaign, biographical material, Thornburgh campaign clippings, correspondence to and from, speeches, and drafts. The Dick Thornburgh File material dates from 1969 to 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref304_e7y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memoranda</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">May–December

election. Following eight years of a Democratic Governor, the GOP was particularly eager to have a Republican elected. The party's activity was especially useful in field organization across the state. Thornburgh had not run for office since an unsuccessful 1966 Campaign for Congress, and was from the western part of Pennsylvania; thus it was advantageous to have the GOP participate both in statewide organizing and fundraising. This was particularly true in the primary. The records in this subseries include: leadership lists, correspondence, events, fundraising, drafts, and plans.

appearances. The files were kept in four binders. One was Philadelphia area counties, and the remaining three most likely represent geographical or campaign organizational logic. The counties are kept together in the original order that they were held in the binders. Multiple copies of the binders were distributed to key staff and Thornburgh. The following information may be found for each county: U.S. census data, population and housing, economic profiles, wards, county statistics, principal industrial employers, media (radio/TV, newspaper), public officials, Republican officials, GOP voter registration, and election results from 1970 and 1976. There are some additional county notes and reports that were not in the binders. The materials date from 1977 to 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref335_bii" level="file"><did><unittitle>Philadelphia area, Philadelphia, Delaware, Montgomery, Bucks, and

was the primary, by Jay Waldman's campaign plan as presented in his memoranda. This election was especially challenging considering that there was a significant Democratic registration edge. There were two noteworthy candidates, Flaherty and Thornburgh, both from Western Pennsylvania. They each were challenged to make themselves and their platforms known across the state, somewhat easier for Flaherty, who had run statewide previously for U.S. Senate, although unsuccessfully. Much campaign effort focused on the Philadelphia area, and in fact the Thornburgh headquarters moved from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia for the general election. The two Lieutenant Governor candidates, Scranton and Casey, had widely divergent backgrounds, resulting in Scranton's active participation in the campaign, and Casey scarcely any, at the request of Flaherty. Much of the information about the candidates will be found in Series IV. Campaign for Governor Opposition Research. Platform and issues can be found in Series V. Campaign Issues. There are two videos of Thornburgh campaign ads that are housed separately in media storage.</p><p>The Flaherty campaign did not conduct as much research by far, and depended instead on Flaherty's charismatic image and mayoral reputation. Polls quietly conducted in the summer by the Thornburgh campaign placed its candidate 32 points behind Flaherty, a stunning fact that was successfully kept secret. In the fall, Thornburgh moved closer and by mid October was "merely" 12-15 points behind, a fact that the campaign vigorously declared "momentum." There were two major debates in the fall that were reported in the news to favor Thornburgh. Thornburgh's issues registered with voters and Flaherty's efforts to stay aloof from the tarnished reputation of the then Governor Shapp administration Democrats were unsuccessful. When election night came, Thornburgh was declared the victor by Walter Cronkite at 8:30 PM, joined by the other networks an hour later. There is significant additional information about this election in the Dick Thornburgh Papers. This series is further divided into four subseries: Memoranda and Notes, Fundraising, Campaign in Progress, and Polls. The material in this series all dates from the election in 1978.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref423_pvm" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Memoranda and Notes</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fc3444c2edba67ab48f0d4e0db98f0ff"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>Waldman's memos spell out the campaign in remarkable detail, and were scrupulously followed. There were many who considered him inexperienced and that he would be unsuccessful. However, Waldman proved them wrong with the successful campaign. In addition to Waldman's memos, there are memoranda from Thornburgh and others. The campaign demands on candidate Thornburgh resulted in more verbal interactions from him and fewer memoranda. The Murray Dickman memos reflect the all-important field organization activity. The memos all date from 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref424_r7t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memoranda from Jay Waldman</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_1f609688d224bbb784440a3079e2201a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_426d08eda8856a585f6558e240ef2a2e" parent="aspace_1f609688d224bbb784440a3079e2201a" type="folder">19</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref425_2bs" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence to/from Jay Waldman</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_da07d3f89b9ce9c115096ed74afd1fa7" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_e81a00edb72eb5c1d6e2b8bf213cf1a9" parent="aspace_da07d3f89b9ce9c115096ed74afd1fa7" type="folder">20</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref426_uxc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Waldman handwritten campaign notes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_4853dcf9110cc30cdf98c803c271b39c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_5a5c89a1945bfb265c27513ae4679e5d" parent="aspace_4853dcf9110cc30cdf98c803c271b39c" type="folder">21</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref427_z2u" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memoranda and correspondence to/from Dick Thornburgh</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_8bf2f31257401d20ca72eeb2012209a6" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_9167561397d1d6510288ae8fd5aeadfe" parent="aspace_8bf2f31257401d20ca72eeb2012209a6" type="folder">22</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref428_1ue" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campaign memoranda from Murray Dickman, 1978</unittitle><container id="aspace_1a135bd45bafbb8a91b0d56bccf59d3d" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_f53d544e88f009d2d4b4382e01d23e8d" parent="aspace_1a135bd45bafbb8a91b0d56bccf59d3d" type="folder">23</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref429_vzd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memoranda and campaign correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_e8ee5d310dcdaced6af10c67c93bdeae" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_e58d14846c37078bfc74a680702984a6" parent="aspace_e8ee5d310dcdaced6af10c67c93bdeae" type="folder">24</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref431_50g" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Fundraising</unittitle><unitid>2.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_339f0af697222837e2ea5ed11d5e4186"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>Fundraising is an unavoidable and challenging process for any campaign, which was made even more difficult being that Thornburgh came from western Pennsylvania.

As Thornburgh was not well known across the state and now was opposed by Flaherty, who had previously campaigned statewide and who also had the decided advantage of far greater Democratic voter registration, meticulous polling was vital. Market Opinion Research (MOR), presented detailed information at a critical time, and in fact was used during the years of Thornburgh's governorship as well. It was during the summer that the alarming realization that Thornburgh was 30 points behind became known within the campaign. Fortunately, however, the campaign staff successfully kept this under wraps so that the essential fundraising would not be affected. Indeed as the campaign neared its end, the 15-point gap was hailed as momentum in early October, although that in itself was worrisome. These August polls and surveys provided significant guidance at a pivotal time in the campaign itself and related to fundraising. The polls material all dates from 1978.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref475_sxk" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA Voting Analysis</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">August 1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_30865c672a1ae0fa26e400ec7bd170dd" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">14</container><container id="aspace_7ba3544a880841ed3490850c4423dd07" parent="aspace_30865c672a1ae0fa26e400ec7bd170dd" type="folder">18</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref476_3lk" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA Statewide Analysis</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">August 1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6496e975ea15aa54aeba0ed57f43643" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">14</container><container id="aspace_95ade2ed91c506b6ffcf2a85a309aee6" parent="aspace_f6496e975ea15aa54aeba0ed57f43643" type="folder">19</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref477_vc8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Binder, PA Statewide Study, Data</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">August 1978</unitdate><container id="aspace_ccf60c259019e76c2828c02869cd53a6" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">14</container><container id="aspace_74003a3243e6e6fcfbd2a0ce569fd644" parent="aspace_ccf60c259019e76c2828c02869cd53a6" type="folder">20</container></did></c03></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref480_8l2" level="series"><did><unittitle>Gubernatorial Transition</unittitle><unitid>VIII.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978" type="inclusive">1978</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_28b49310144cee645dfaf4cc0d720ebb"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>On November 7, 1978, Dick Thornburgh was elected of Pennsylvania. The period of time between the election and when the Governor-elect is inaugurated is referred to as the Transition. Thornburgh's campaign staff lost no time putting together a vigorous transition team to immediately seek information about the departments of government, their shortcoming and successes. Study teams were formed, the members of which included noteworthy, knowledgeable community persons from across the state. The files documented in this series are predominately reports by study committees. These reports helped set goals and guide subsequent courses of action for the Thornburgh administration. Some additional study team reports can be found in the Dick Thornburgh Papers. The files in this subseries date from November to December, 1978.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref481_fpg" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The First Six Months," Thornburgh letter to Shapp, Study

However, the steel industry in Pennsylvania was deeply troubled at the time and Reagonomics at the national level was unpopular, both of which meant that Pennsylvania voters were discontented generally in 1982. Thus, a rather unknown and undistinguished one term Democrat congressman, Allen Ertel, came far closer to winning than anyone expected. The Ertel campaign pursued unwarranted issues and made many false claims about the Thornburgh administration and campaign. Despite these factors, Thornburgh won, and compared to other Republicans, he won by a larger margin than any of the others. There are three campaign videos included in this series and are housed separately in media storage. Two are Thornburgh campaign ads, and the other Ertel campaign ads. This series is further divided into four subseries: MOR polling, Thornburgh Administration Accomplishments, Ertel Opposition Research, and Campaign-in-Progress.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref495_9h4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Market Opinion Research (MOR) Polling</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1982/1982" type="inclusive">1982</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c694428dcd25a8bd7848624edd52fdaf"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>As a result of general voter discontent, the polling became particularly important.

The Thornburgh campaign was particularly alert to these needs with extensive and detailed resultant information. Ertel had been in state government, but was at this time a one term U.S. Congressman. His record was not distinguished, but no stones were left unturned in his assessment. Ertel's conduct of the campaign was challenging and is documented in the following files. The first seven Folders comprise what was originally the Ertel opposition research binder put together for campaign guidance and reference.

First on the list was the appointment of Jay C. Waldman as Executive Assistant to the Governor. Waldman and Thornburgh had by then a mutual well-established respect and admiration for one another. Waldman had not only been with Thornburgh in various positions since 1970, but also had master minded the campaign for Governor with all the meticulous attention to the needs and problems in Pennsylvania. Thus Waldman was considered early as the key strategist and tactician to accomplish the administration's goals. It was Waldman who would, as Thornburgh states in his autobiography "conduct a political assessment, determining whether the policy was consistent with our overall philosophy and campaign themes, how key supporters or interest groups were likely to react (and whether that mattered) and how the policy fit into the long-term big picture." Waldman had expanded legal responsibilities after his appointment by Thornburgh in January 1981 to the newly created position of General Counsel (OGC) to the Governor. In that role Waldman not only assured the Governor and others in the executive branch of legal counsel to protect their interests, but also served to bring an independent perspective in reviewing the numerous cases that involved the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. There is one video of Reagan campaign ads done by Thornburgh housed separately in media storage. This series is further divided into five subseries: Waldman Governor's Office Files, Governor's Office Legal, Dick Thornburgh Files, Thornburgh Administration, and Political.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref574_gdu" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Waldman Governor's Office Files</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1963/1985" type="inclusive">1963-1985</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c0701701765d02c8faccd8100073aa97"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>These files are both when Waldman (JCW) served as Executive Assistant to the Governor in 1981 and following as General Counsel. This subseries represents his specific leadership, including overall accomplishments as compared with legal cases and political matters that follow in subsequent subseries. They were better identified with Waldman's own labeling. Of particular value are folders relating to the organization of the Governor's Office in the early administration, two major folders of accomplishments, and the Waldman correspondence. The correspondence files contain occasional memoranda and drafts of letters. The Waldman's Governor's Office Files date from 1963 to 1985.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref575_7m8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memo, Cabinet meetings</unittitle><unitdate

original order and with his identifying labels. Waldman's notes and many actual cases in multiple formats and accompanying court documentation are also included. Some are more "political" in nature, while others are more issue related. At the end of this subseries there are extensive files about a case to U.S. Court of Appeals, and a subsequent Supreme Court case argued on behalf of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by Waldman and others. Case name: Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, et al, Petitioners, v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, et al, Respondents. It is abbreviated in folder titles: PA v Del.

Additionally, there are political news clippings about Thornburgh and other political figures as well as some miscellaneous political articles, correspondence, and election results.
