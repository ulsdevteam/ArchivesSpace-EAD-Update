    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Born in 1952 in Columbus, Ohio, Richard St. John is a poet and the author of two published volumes of poetry, titled <emph>The Pure Inconstancy of Grace</emph> (2005) and <emph>Each Perfected Name</emph> (2015), and one chapbook, titled <emph>Shrine</emph> (2011). St. John and his family moved to suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1955. Under the influence of a gifted middle and high school teacher, St. John became interested in poetry and, by the time of his 1970 graduation from high school, he was fully committed to becoming a poet. He attended Princeton University, graduating summa cum laude with a B.A. in English in 1974, and then went to the University of Virginia for his M.A. in English in 1975. It was during this time at U.VA that he became engaged to his longtime friend, Katherine "Kate" Mitchell, and after completing his degree, they married.</p><p>St. John considered teaching as a career, but following his graduation from college, he accepted a position at a Pittsburgh advertising agency, Creamer FSR, where he worked for four years. Wanting to commit himself to poetry more, he entered the nonprofit sector in 1981 and secured a half-time writing position with the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. In 1982, he accepted a full-time position at the Conference with a mix of writing and program responsibilities, including work in the organization's new program area of neighborhood development.</p><p>From 1984 through 1990, he worked with Oakland Planning and Development Corporation (OPDC) as Associate Director and then as Executive Director. While at OPDC, he completed a National Internship in Community Development through the Development Training Institute headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. He continued working in neighborhood development as a real estate development consultant to a tenants' organization and subsequently, from 1992 to 2001, as Executive Director for the Community Design Center of Pittsburgh. Throughout this period, he also was active with a variety of nonprofit boards, commissions, and coalitions, including the Mayor's Zoning Advisory Group (as co-chair), Sustainable Pittsburgh, the Community Technical Assistance Center, the Working Group on Community Development, and others. </p><p>In the mid-1990s, in the hope of having a collection published, St. John began sending his book-length poetry manuscripts to publishers while continuing to work in the nonprofit sector. In 2001, St. John left the Community Design Center of Pittsburgh and accepted a mid-career Loeb Fellowship for independent study at Harvard University. Returning to Pittsburgh in 2002, he raised funds and initiated Conversations for Common Wealth (CCW), a program which used poetry and other materials to help diverse groups reflect on the ethical callings in their lives. He also assisted the Community House Literacy Center and Community House Presbyterian Church with various projects, including renovation of new space for both organizations.</p><p>In 2004, one of his manuscripts was selected as first runner-up for the T.S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and one year later, Truman State University Press published that collection as <emph>The Pure Inconstancy of Grace</emph>. In 2007, at the conclusion of both CCW and Community House projects, he became Executive Director of Autumn House Press in Pittsburgh, a nationally respected nonprofit publisher of poetry, fiction and creative non-fiction. St. John left Autumn House Press to pursue conversations-related partnerships in 2011 and subsequently accepted a position as Executive Director for the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition, retiring from that position in late 2014. </p><p>In the same decade, Finishing Line Press published his long poem as a chapbook, titled <emph>Shrine</emph> (2011), and Truman State University Press published his second full-length collection, titled <emph>Each Perfected Name</emph> (2015). Throughout his writing career, St. John was published in numerous newspapers and literary journals, such as The <emph>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</emph>, <emph>Pittsburgh City Paper</emph>, <emph>Carolina Quarterly</emph>, <emph>Sewanee Review</emph>, and <emph>The Fourth River</emph>. In addition, St. John has read his poetry at numerous cafés, universities, and events. St. John still continues to write and has completed a third full-length collection of poetry with the working title <emph>Book of Entangled Souls</emph>, which is scheduled for publication by Broadstone Books in 2022.</p>  </bioghist>

correspondences during the 2000s. Additionally, St. John's writing planner and poetry reading advertisements from this decade can also be found within the subseries. Some of the dates range to years outside of the 2000s due to the author's later revision of the poems. Oversized materials that appear in this series can be found in Oversize 5.
