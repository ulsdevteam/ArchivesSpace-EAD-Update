    <abstract id="aspace_6b4dc5871a61689269fff12fb8ccb938">Dick Thornburgh was sworn in as the United States Attorney for Western Pennsylvania on June 4, 1969. Fighting organized crime was Thornburgh's top priority from the outset and he set forth plans for stepped-up antiracketeering efforts, including the use of a special strike force. One high profile case handled under Thornburgh's tenure was the case of official corruption of Pittsburgh District Attorney Robert Duggan. Other major cases included names such as Grosso, Mazzei, Hilton, Ferraro, Iannelli, Ferrone, La Rocca, Torquato and Bruno. Other major topics covered in the files include illegal drug traffic, civil rights/police brutality cases, and environmental litigation. The files are arranged in twelve sections: Speeches; News Releases; Public Statements; Events; Correspondence; USA Thornburgh's Files; Memoranda; Attorney General's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee; Strike Forces Subcommittee of the Attorney General's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee; Subcommittees of the Attorney General's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee; USA Office Cases; and Issue References.

"Marking, as it did, my first ascendance to full-time public office, the ceremony was particularly memorable for me and I felt a special sense of awe in swearing to 'uphold the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,' a challenge that was to prove worthy of my every effort over the next six years" ("Evidence" draft, p. 145). </p><p>Coincidentally the Pennsylvania Crime Commission released a major report on organized crime in the Commonwealth the very day Thornburgh's appointment was announced, thus making fighting organized crime Thornburgh's top priority from the outset. Organized crime was deeply entrenched in many facets of Western Pennsylvania business and politics including $4-6 million said to be paid illegally to Allegheny County law enforcement officials. Thornburgh "set forth plans for stepped-up antiracketeering efforts, including better coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local agencies, as well as the use of a special strike force to concentrate federal efforts" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 41). "By the time I left office in mid-1975, we had mounted an unprecedented effort against corruption at the federal, state and local levels" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 48).</p><p>Among the high profile cases handled under Thornburgh tenure was the case of official corruption of Pittsburgh District Attorney Robert Duggan, who ultimately took his own life rather than face prosecution. Other major cases included names such as Grosso, Mazzei, Hilton, Ferraro, Iannelli, Ferrone, La Rocca, Torquato and Bruno. In addition to racketeering and public corruption, the illegal drug traffic issue was a major target as were civil rights/police brutality cases and environmental litigation. "These public corruption cases were a high priority for the office and for me personally as I felt that betrayal of the public trust was so subversive of our democratic processes. I was equally proud that Democrats and Republicans alike were, if corrupt, pursued with equal vigor, as we sought in all cases to truly 'follow the evidence wherever it leads'" ("Evidence" draft, p. 195).</p><p>Public recognition of Thornburgh's success as U.S. Attorney was evidenced by the Pittsburgh <title xlink:type="simple">Post Gazette</title>'s article entitled "Silver Knight of Area Law Enforcement." This and other such favorable publicity about Thornburgh's prosecution of corruption and racketeering cases, in particular, led to his appointment in March 1975, as Assistant Attorney General and head of the Criminal Division in Washington, an opportunity he could not pass up. "The six years I spent in the U.S. Attorney's office had not only developed my professional lawyering skills, but had given me new insights into the challenges of public management ... [and were] the happiest of my professional life" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 60, and 219).</p><p>The files are arranged in twelve sections: "Speeches," "News Releases," "Public Statements," "Events," "Correspondence," "USA Thornburgh's Files," "Memoranda," "Attorney General's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee," "Strike Forces Subcommittee of the Attorney General's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee," "Subcommittees of the Attorney General's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee," "USA Office Cases," and "Issue References." </p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref10_igj" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Speeches</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d8525da623a8c901dffe8af1e7a5a5f1"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Speeches, available online, are arranged chronologically and titles include: speech title (when designated), group or event to which it was delivered, and location. Thornburgh delivered these U.S. Attorney speeches at various professional, political, and community occasions. Related information will be found here in "Events."

July 1975. The first section is a miscellaneous group of memoranda from various persons at DOJ, several related to the USA Advisory Committee, and three from Scarlata, a Thornburgh staff attorney. All the remaining and numerous memoranda are an intriguing array sent by Thornburgh to staff members or "to file" and cover a wide range of topics, especially including cases. Since actual case files ultimately were kept by the Office, these memoranda serve as the only internal reference to these notable cases. The memoranda were used generally by Thornburgh to communicate updates and information on criminal activities, criminal cases, investigations, allegations, and procedures to staff and colleagues.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref227_ust" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Memoranda from DOJ and USA staff attorneys</unittitle></did><c04 id="aspace_ref228_3n3" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1975" type="inclusive">1970-1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_d6b6006d3e1465aa5e82cf0df821852a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_5298d0347891db57fff7bddecd232fdc" parent="aspace_d6b6006d3e1465aa5e82cf0df821852a" type="folder">1</container></did></c04></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref229_qtl" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Memoranda from USA Thornburgh</unittitle></did><c04 id="aspace_ref230_qqk" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation">June 5, 1969 - December 31, 1969</unitdate><container id="aspace_c63e06963aefaa82c9f978578a1f94f3" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_09be274799c1c22ac733e5faf90730ad" parent="aspace_c63e06963aefaa82c9f978578a1f94f3" type="folder">2-3</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref231_h70" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1970" type="inclusive">1970</unitdate><container id="aspace_18dbf7be7e9ad1b443d91099fdd70665" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_ea286cc38620ca7802e65ed181d506d1" parent="aspace_18dbf7be7e9ad1b443d91099fdd70665" type="folder">4-7</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref232_bnb" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1971" type="inclusive">1971</unitdate><container id="aspace_b8871dd35338ce2304e670f55d3b9a9c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_91901e2ef8b2f2886fee4d540645a288" parent="aspace_b8871dd35338ce2304e670f55d3b9a9c" type="folder">8-11</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref233_tti" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1972" type="inclusive">1972</unitdate><container id="aspace_cf7cf27cb9092a4c464dd52eb9a710a0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_38b0294bd3c7cf034bc5788de1240003" parent="aspace_cf7cf27cb9092a4c464dd52eb9a710a0" type="folder">12-14</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref234_l9l" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973</unitdate><container id="aspace_b019931dddcb2a6bf79205730d3362a5" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_f98e185d2b8f432699c31e5fcf69cd2b" parent="aspace_b019931dddcb2a6bf79205730d3362a5" type="folder">15-17</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref235_miq" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974</unitdate><container id="aspace_6c4af1f7c30c8aea09881809fe2adec0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_00da54cf164033477db04292459cca7c" parent="aspace_6c4af1f7c30c8aea09881809fe2adec0" type="folder">18-20</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref236_m5z" level="file"><did><unitdate datechar="creation">January-July, 1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_28158cf8c2ea939dcb7dd27b0958e2dd" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">42</container><container id="aspace_f0d6a68a41f8987d3afc957895343086" parent="aspace_28158cf8c2ea939dcb7dd27b0958e2dd" type="folder">21-22</container></did></c04></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref238_pku" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Attorney General's United States Attorneys Advisory Committee</unittitle><unitid>8.</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_57bc4aabda5f498982d587143fc4a88f"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Folders here are arranged chronologically and include minutes and reports from the Advisory Committee (AGAC) meetings (1974-1975).

The AG's Advisory Committee of U.S. Attorneys was made of a dozen representative holders of that office and became, over the years, a valuable sounding board for a succession of Attorney Generals.

Most of the focus of this inquiry was on the "Strike Forces" operated out of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department's Criminal Division (see "Strike Forces Subcommittee" files here). Materials include: memoranda, reports and annotated articles.

The materials primarily evaluate the effectiveness of strike forces within various U.S. Attorney jurisdictions. These includes memoranda, teletypes, correspondence, news releases, reports, annotated articles and the questionnaire that Thornburgh issued to all of the U.S. Attorneys for evaluation of the Organized Crime Strike Forces in their districts. The final reports of this subcommittee are included with the above "Advisory Committee" files.</p><p>Strike Forces are federal teams comprised of investigators and prosecutors who combine their efforts in a single geographic area with a significant organized crime problem in an attempt to control organized crime and racketeering activities within that area. "The 'Strike Forces' had become institutionalized and expanded under [Attorney General] John Mitchell to the point that considerable friction had developed in a number of areas over 'turf' issues and the allocation of cases between the U.S. Attorney, the presidentially-appointed chief law enforcement officer for the district, and the local 'Strike Force' chief, appointed by and responsible to the Attorney General ... Our report, ultimately recommended that the 'Strike Forces' be returned to their original status as 'trouble-shooting' teams and that the role of the U.S.Attorney as the chief federal law enforcement officer in his community be reaffirmed" ("Evidence" draft, p. 196-7).</p><p>Files of the other subcommittees of the Attorney General's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee follow here.

It should be noted, however, that there are extremely interesting references to cases in the "Memoranda" section. The cases involve official corruption in Pennsylvania government, organized crime and racketeering. The bulk of the material focuses on the official corruption case involving District Attorney Robert Duggan, chief of Pittsburgh's Racket Squad.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref273_h81" level="file"><did><unittitle>Government case News Clippings (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1969/1975" type="inclusive">1969-1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_a3d97bb1d35b6994de855368ceb784e1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_3b4162765a70e83dae500bc792b02987" parent="aspace_a3d97bb1d35b6994de855368ceb784e1" type="folder">7</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref274_tar" level="file"><did><unittitle>Case articles (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1969/1975" type="inclusive">1969-1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_e6af2cbaf48b77f46975dc08495e0342" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_58eea23ac39ada8c85ee85d24b5ef6e7" parent="aspace_e6af2cbaf48b77f46975dc08495e0342" type="folder">8-9</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref275_pg8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Robert Duggan Case</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1966/1974" type="inclusive">1966-1974</unitdate><container id="aspace_19fd55079eafbb20a721bb6cbe82f9b0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_872d70541916638c5a2e187c79c53ed9" parent="aspace_19fd55079eafbb20a721bb6cbe82f9b0" type="folder">10-11</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref276_mtt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Robert Duggan Case Clippings (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1969/1977" type="inclusive">1969-1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_37218c31e8e719063c26c66bcaa5fe9f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_221079e0ca8c3fa3251919b9306e65da" parent="aspace_37218c31e8e719063c26c66bcaa5fe9f" type="folder">12</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref277_n5t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Samuel Ferraro Case Clippings (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1973/1974" type="inclusive">1973-1974</unitdate><container id="aspace_72b9614be953283fd1101b1a90e63e80" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_55221c098b7eeedc245a78350c926e10" parent="aspace_72b9614be953283fd1101b1a90e63e80" type="folder">13</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref278_5p1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Frank Mazzei Case Clippings (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_2d27c9474eb03258754da6cf7f503fb7" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_f4dcc494ea003aa0833dd5497a601dfe" parent="aspace_2d27c9474eb03258754da6cf7f503fb7" type="folder">14</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref279_vcz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Frank Hilton Case Clippings (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1975" type="inclusive">1974-1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_87ba9491e1b71eecbba537941cf67244" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_9c7d43109a0e2c40bd955bf15d07b087" parent="aspace_87ba9491e1b71eecbba537941cf67244" type="folder">15</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref280_nii" level="file"><did><unittitle>Milton Shapp and Gene Coon Case Clippings (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_03cebc920fddc3acc7f9e56819093feb" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_ef3fe03d87c58c0218a50f6afd36aea6" parent="aspace_03cebc920fddc3acc7f9e56819093feb" type="folder">16</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref281_icg" level="file"><did><unittitle>Anthony Grosso, Frank Bruno and Eugene Coon Case Clippings (annotated)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1973/1975" type="inclusive">1973-1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_47fe5d82b697bcd0ab38546496a48a1a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_e53abec1e1d01627d8d3ebc84be64dd6" parent="aspace_47fe5d82b697bcd0ab38546496a48a1a" type="folder">17</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref283_hzq" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Issue References</unittitle><unitid>12.</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_147463185f44cc12759de6b6641715e1"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The Issue References are grouped by topics as follow: Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, Other Issues, and Reports.
