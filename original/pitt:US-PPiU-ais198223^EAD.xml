    <head>History</head>
<p>The Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad (P&amp;LE) began operation in 1879 after the 1878 consolidation with the Youngstown &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Company. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pa., the P&amp;LE line began as a single track railroad connecting Pittsburgh to Youngstown, Ohio. The railroad began its affiliation with the New York Central System in 1883 and, by 1890, was one of the principle rail routes in the eastern United States. Financed in part by the Harmony Society, a communal religious sect located just north of Pittsburgh in Economy, Pa., and in part by William Henry Vanderbilt's Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway, the P&amp;LE had extended south to Connellsville, Pa., and handled six times the amount of freight it had in 1880, earning its nickname, the "Little Giant."</p><p>The P&amp;LE continued to progress into the twentieth century thanks, in part, to the advances in railroad technology. The development of all-steel cars made it possible to carry a load of up to 50-tons. Additionally, advancements made in train brakes through the Westinghouse air brake system and automatic couplers, allowed P&amp;LE trains to run safely at faster speeds and carry heavier coal loads.</p><p>The P&amp;LE also operated as a passenger line. Beginning with its first passenger train in February 1879, the railroad became a heavily used line by travelers and commuters. Although passenger trips were relatively small, the average trip was around 20 miles. Until 1941, the passenger trains accounted for one-half the miles of the freight trains. However, the rise of popularity of motor trucks, private cars, and buses led to the eventual decline of train travel. By the mid-1970s, only one commuter train remained on the P&amp;LE line.</p><p>While the early 1970s brought a decline in passenger travel, the freight lines continued to grow. In 1976, following the 1970 bankruptcy of the Penn Central System, the railroad obtained trackage rights over former Penn Central lines to Ashtabula Harbor, Oh., located on Lake Erie and through Sharon to Shenango, Pa. The railroad was purchased by CSX Transportation in 1993.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection was inventoried by several graduate students in the fall of 2010 which produced a box-level inventory. An intellectual arrangement was then created based on each individual railroad line that comprised the P&amp;LE. The corresponding box information is included, but note that the material is loosely arranged in the boxes and in no significant order. The physical arrangement is imprecise and uncontrolled because up to this point, no processing has been done to any part of this collection other than the photographs. Considering that a number of people worked to create this box inventory and the scale of this collection is so large, the contents may not be exactly what the finding aid claims them to be.</p><p>Each series represents the various railroad lines found within the overall company records of the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad, followed by non-manuscript materials. Five subseries exist within the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad series, giving a rough outline of the large amount of materials generated by the operation of the railroad.</p><p>Series I.

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>The Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Company Records document the management and operation of the company throughout its long history, from around 1850 to 1999. These materials contain information about Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad (P&amp;LE), as well as the various branch lines that, along with P&amp;LE, were controlled by the New York Central Railroad System from 1883 until 1968, and later by Penn Central from 1968 until 1970. Regardless of the large number of materials, this is not a complete record of P&amp;LE history, or of its subsidiaries.</p><p>The manuscript material includes a large number of bound ledgers of meeting minutes, statistics, operational logs, and reports. Many ledgers contain letter or telegraph correspondence between personnel, external companies, subsidiaries, and employees. Employee records comprise card indexes, files, and folders of terminated, retired, furloughed, and deceased employees as well as applications, recommendations, rates of pay, sick and vacation time, and union agreements. Legal documents consist of claims and grievances against P&amp;LE by employees, companies, cities, and citizens; articles of agreement concerning the lease of equipment, land, and tracks; and contracts between P&amp;LE, its subsidiaries and associate companies. Publications scattered throughout the collection include federal regulations (many of the Interstate Commerce Commission), company safety policy and handbooks, national railroad magazines, and multi-railroad agreements. Bulletins and notices were distributed within the company and sometimes are referred to as 'pink sheets.' There is also a substantial presence of blueprints of buildings and tracks and schematics for equipment and machinery. </p><p>The collection contains over two thousand feet of 16mm motion picture film depicting railroad work crews in the 1930s, various construction projects, a parade of boats on the Monongahela River, and safety and training procedures. Audio cassettes relate to personal safety of employees and the operation of certain railroad equipment. Slides depict safety training exercises and methods, hazardous materials, and other standard safety practices. The film, cassettes, and slides are noted in the Training Materials series. Only the Photographs series in this collection has been processed. The remaining materials have been housed in records boxes, manuscript boxes, filing cabinets, or paper wrappings and still comprise their original folders or none at all. All materials are available for on-site review.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was box-inventoried by University of Pittsburgh graduate students Emily Hikes, Jennifer Needham, and Bryan Moll in Fall 2010; previously, Matthew Elder, an undergraduate History intern, began the inventory in Fall 2009. Emily was responsible for arranging the contents of the inventory to use in this finding aid. The initial collection of photographs and materials form the New York Central System were processed by Frank J. Kurtik in 1982. In Spring 2010, an updated finding aid was written and published by Miriam Meislik and Renee Ziemann. It is now subsumed into this finding aid. Series XIV. Maps, Drawings and Plans was processed by Debbie Rougeux in Spring 2014. Items in this series were sorted into categories based on the other series in the collection. In addition to the information in the finding aid, additonal data on each item was entered into a spreadsheet.</p>  </processinfo>

It may be best known by its hot metal bridge, which was used to carry molten iron across the Monongahela River from J&amp;L's Eliza Furnaces to the Bessemer converters and rolling mills at J&amp;L's South Side facility. The railroad was also a dieselization pioneer, buying many early diesel locomotives from Alco, General Electric and other manufacturers.</p><p>The Monongahela Connecting Railroad series includes litigation, reports, correspondence, and daily operational materials from 1870 to 1991. Documentation in this collection is the most complete of any of the subsidiaries and provides a complete picture of the operations of this line from its beginning with only some overlap with other railroads. Many of the ledgers pertaining to this railroad contains correspondence between Frank McCune, the General Superintendent of the Monongahela Connecting Railroad (early 1900s), and other companies and employees. Unlike some of the other material found in this collection, this series offers an important perspective because it documents railroad communications from the top down.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref35_9i8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Law Dept - Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway Bankruptcy, CSX vs. Monongahela Railroad, Burlington Northern Railroad Co. vs. P&amp;LE, Norfolk Western vs. P&amp;LE</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1970s-1980s</unitdate><container id="aspace_db862b0019fc99d4b04183e42c91d60b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">110</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref58_pz1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abandonment of Track in Marion W.

The first segment constructed extended southward from Montour Junction (near  Coraopolis, Pa.) to the town of Imperial, Pa. In 1912 the railroad underwent a major expansion, and by 1917 reached West Mifflin by way of McDonald, Cecil, and Bethel Park. It became an important link in the rail transportation system serving Pittsburgh, Youngstown, Oh., and Cleveland because it connected to all five of the trunk railroads serving the area. The Montour served 27 mines and carried almost seven million tons of coal annually by its peak in 1930. Other freight was virtually incidental, and passenger service was abandoned in the 1920s. In 1946 the Montour Railroad was sold jointly to the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad. The P&amp;LE acquired sole ownership in 1975. As costs continued to rise and revenues decrease, operations ceased entirely in 1984.</p><p>This series is another which contains a wide breath of information for the understanding of how the company functioned on a day-to-day basis through its different departments and how it dealt with problems that arose. Included materials span from 1898 to 1995 and are related to general operations of the railroad, such as employee records and wages, annual reports, bulletins, equipment logs, litigation, and engineering records. There are also some case files and hearings relating to the Lake Erie and Ohio Canal in this series.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref56_qy6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Engineering (Montour Railroad): Bridges, Bridge Inspection Under grade Reports (1968-78), McDonald Viaduct, Weed Program (1961-68), Mileage of Tracks Change in Track Reports (1961-76), Track Renewal and maintenance reports (1975-79)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1979" type="inclusive">1961-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_404ccd1d85dba92d3be0cddd7edd35d4" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">77</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref181_gfs" level="file"><did><unittitle>Research, publications, etc. concerning Coal and Coke Context in Pennsylvania</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">Early 1900s, 1950s, 1970s</unitdate><container id="aspace_9ad8a0ef0ffd6e293a08a42dd0dd4607" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">30</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref182_c93" level="file"><did><unittitle>Engineering (Montour Railroad): Bridges, Bridge Inspection Under grade Reports (1968-78), McDonald Viaduct, Weed Program (1961-68), Mileage of Tracks Change in Track Reports (1961-76), Track Renewal and maintenance reports (1975-79)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1979" type="inclusive">1961-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_8dee77e8b096c374f85d669ef4981c00" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">77</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref183_55d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Workers agreements - Clerks, Shop Crafts, Steelworkers, Engineers, Yardmasters, Trainmen, Engineers.

Headquartered in New York, the railroad served most of the Northeast, including extensive trackage in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Massachusetts, plus additional trackage in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The railroad primarily connected greater New York and Boston in the east with Chicago and St. Louis in the midwest along with the intermediate cities of Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Detroit. The New York Central's Grand Central Terminal in New York City is one of its best known extant landmarks. In 1968 the New York Central merged with its former rival, the Pennsylvania Railroad, to form Penn Central. The Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad was operated by both the New York Central Railroad and Penn Central during their years of existence. </p><p>The series is completely comprised of boxes containing bound annual reports of the New York Central Railroad.  The reports include New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad Co.; Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Co.; Michigan Central Railroad Co.; Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad Co.; Indiana Illinois &amp; Iowa Railroad Co.; Indiana Harbor Railroad Co.; Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railroad Co.; Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Co.; Rutland Railroad Co.; New York Central Railroad Co.; Mahoning Coal Railroad Co.; Toronto Hamilton &amp; Buffalo Railway Co.; Peoria &amp; Eastern Railway Co.; Central Union Depot &amp; Railway Co. of Cincinnati. Not all of these railroads appear in every book, but they will appear somewhere in the books in this series. In addition, the reports list leased and controlled lines together with additional statistical financial and corporate information for the use of their officers.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref1035_jwg" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York Central Lines Athletic Associations Sixth Annual Track Meet to be Held At Pitt Stadium Sept. 18th 1929 (3586 FF8-1), Freight House Office Building Floor Plan (1785 JA3), The Monongahela Railway Showing Coal and Coke Operations (14193 - KF -12 and 209 - K - 393)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1929/1929" type="inclusive">1929</unitdate><container id="aspace_273d9b58000a420486b252e7c8801c47" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">137</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref1034_haw" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York Central Railway blueprints (1950s) MCRR: Agreements with Consolidation Coal Co (1935-47); correspondence concerning issues of the West Pittsburgh Station (1946-61)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1961" type="inclusive">1935-1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_29818e5f14de289f219e540b9a5d9cbc" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">402</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref984_i7o" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York Central Railroad System Annual Reports</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1905/1965" type="inclusive">1905-1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_4dbebcd67874381cf2bb96678545d0db" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">600-613</container></did></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref31_nec" level="series"><did><unittitle>Pittsburgh, Chartiers &amp; Youghiogheny Railroad</unittitle><unitid>VI.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1898/1995" type="inclusive">1898-1995</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7e3ff7eb5183543cf6dc262a25d3f161"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>On May 26, 1892, the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Company purchased one-half interest in the Pittsburgh, Chartiers &amp; Youghiogheny Railroad Company.

Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pa., the P&amp;LE line began as a single track railroad connecting Pittsburgh to Youngstown, Ohio. The railroad began its affiliation with the New York Central System in 1883 and, by 1890, was one of the principle rail routes in the eastern United States. As it grew, it became able to handle six times the amount of freight it had in 1880, earning its nickname, the "Little Giant." In 1879 the railroad became heavily used line by travelers and commuters. Eventually, the rise of motor trucks, private cars, and buses led to the decline of train travel, and by the mid-1970s, only one commuter train remained on the P&amp;LE line.</p><p>While the early 1970s brought a decline in passenger travel, the freight lines continued to grow. In 1976, following the 1970 bankruptcy of the Penn Central System, the railroad obtained trackage rights over former Penn Central lines to Ashtabula Harbor, Oh., located on Lake Erie and through Sharon to Shenango, Pennsylvania. The railroad was purchased by CSX Transportation in 1993.</p><p>The materials in this series are further divided into subseries to give an outline of the functions and operations of the Pittsburgh  &amp; Lake Erie Railroad. </p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref43_cpw" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Engineering</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1850/1944" type="inclusive">1850-1944</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_752c165bd593d25d02067a4b0b2723b0"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>Records in the collection pertaining to engineering are often explicitly labeled as such by the railroad.

Blueprints, studies, and many newspaper clippings create a record of this canal and highlight the interest Pittsburgh and its railroad industry had in this project which never took place.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref48_zy7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Trainmen rosters (1980s), Bulletin Orders (1980s), Tax Assessments (1930), blueprints and work orders to Bethlehem Steel for rail cars and 250-ton steel wreck crane</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1930/1986" type="inclusive">1930-1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_5f0328c8c6e90bd37b5296556c748ea0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref285_45u" level="file"><did><unittitle>Locomotive serial numbers and information files</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1930/1970" type="inclusive">1930-1970</unitdate><container id="aspace_794a571e97c5db72f54889b3510dcced" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref286_zmo" level="file"><did><unittitle>Parts diagrams and blueprints and information</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1970s</unitdate><container id="aspace_21c96eec887d9f4d7a6c772ac82e9e61" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref287_5iu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Legal documents (land transfers, etc); Office of Engineer building specs for various equipment and implementation (ex. switches)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1915/1946" type="inclusive">1915-1946</unitdate><container id="aspace_d10225a6b1cbf691cb2dcf38dd174cc1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">8</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref288_lpb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rail purchase, Robins Car Shakeout Installation/ Blueprints, Scale house and track scales construction, Dravosburg Bridge and Blue prints, flashing light RR crossing system</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1940s</unitdate><container id="aspace_10ef6c4db9f74e299e8aeb31244bbe4e" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">20</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref289_ul0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Office of Chief Engineer legal files (suits, laws, and government acts)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1980" type="inclusive">1975-1980</unitdate><container id="aspace_e429300b12a9c0d70e50fe8aa15a8f18" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">25</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref290_7n1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Car information files (cars damaged on foreign lines, cars sent home for repairs)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1980s</unitdate><container id="aspace_979ccd220589d0bdb787cacccc1992a4" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">28</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref291_nup" level="file"><did><unittitle>5931 Rajah Oil Co. lease of property and side track, Lansingville and Youngstown Gas and Oil Co. lease of land and sidetrack (1919), 5931 Holub Iron &amp; Steel Co. lease of land at Lansingville (1936), 5951 Pittsburgh &amp; West Virginia Railway Connellsville (1919), 5995 Combustion Engineering Sidetrack-drainage a/c Combustion Engineering Company (1902), 5997-A Lease of Property at Groveton to William Duffy for camping (1924), 6030-A Pittsburgh Knife and Forge Company Siding Coraopolis (1919)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1902/1936" type="inclusive">1902-1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_2dd6ba5fe4127d77be4a5cd3972ee39a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">75</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref292_ukt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Colona River Rail Transfer Plant (1932), Colona River Rail Transfer Plant Track Scale (1931), Colona River Rail Transfer Plant (1896-1927), Colona River Rail Transfer Plant (1930), Colona River Rail Transfer Plant Electric (1931), Colona River Rail Transfer Plant - Fixed Charges, reconditioning, dredging (1933)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1896/1933" type="inclusive">1896-1933</unitdate><container id="aspace_fb771f3d027648ecdbd5b36c8e4af90a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">76</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref293_ec6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Proposals for New Telephone Switch P&amp;LE, Pittsburgh Telephone Co.

After P&amp;LE's decline, the newly-created PL&amp;W Railroad began operating the Y&amp;S under lease on May 1, 1993, and transferred the lease to the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad, a part of the Ohio Central Railroad System, on June 14, 1995.</p><p>Although its history spans 1904 to 1993, the materials in this series are scant and leave large gaps. What is present are meeting minutes, annual reports, the merger proposal for Montour and Y&amp;S, and litigation involving the closing of Montour and Y&amp;S.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref264_8xi" level="file"><did><unittitle>Engineering Department - 1956 Zoning Ordinance; files on Montour Railroad and Youngstown &amp; Southern Railroad acquisitions; main line switch; City Planning reports; crossings; property purchases; articles of agreement</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1898/1958" type="inclusive">1898-1958</unitdate><container id="aspace_a43fef12b654a93b9772749106f06e9c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">218</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref265_k4s" level="file"><did><unittitle>Youngstown Suburban Railroad Co. minutes and record books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1903/1925" type="inclusive">1903-1925</unitdate><container id="aspace_b16929d476e7ed95a8480bb811e572ea" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">350</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref266_jmm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual reports of Lake Erie &amp; Eastern, Youngstown &amp; Southern, Mahoning State Line, and Montour railroads</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1949/1979" type="inclusive">1949-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_e8732ddb9374da66af32b13b44ca104a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">377</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref267_61b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Maintenance of Way agreements; P&amp;LE news bureau releases; stockholder meetings; vendor brochures; published annual reports; Montour agreements; irregularities and disciplines; Youngstown Superintendent Association meeting notes and correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1960s-1970s</unitdate><container id="aspace_ae2d65a4c73540d002e099d812326015" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">379</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref268_mlx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Laws and litigation of Montour and Y&amp;S closings; filed complaints; police commissions</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1942/1968" type="inclusive">1942-1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_dfbe85cd52c2e728731d83dad6ccbf75" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">385a</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref269_fn1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Building costs booklet; daily locomotive performance records; valuation docket of Montour; train statistics of Interstate Commerce Commission; contracts; Y&amp;S merger proposal; Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad correspondence; policeman commissions; numerous loose blueprints</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1914/1994" type="inclusive">1914-1994</unitdate><container id="aspace_e9de55755b946e03dc87858cbdc273b1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">516a</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref270_tcw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chief Engineer's Office correspondence concerning equipment and purchase orders, employee age limits; publication information; Youngstown &amp; Southern Railroad Transfer Contract; physical requirements; matters of signals, transportation, and storage; test equipment; microfiches of interchange</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1932/1989" type="inclusive">1932-1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_2a07bcb55c8e034dd56c672109549466" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">524</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref271_kzf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Locomotive school study books and review questions; annual proceedings for various rail associations; port authority commuter rail study; authority for expenditure of Y&amp;S Railway, AAR bulletins concerning claim work; "facts about featherbedding;" Montour expense book (1960); Montour balance sheets (1921-23); annual reports of P&amp;LE, Mahoning, Beaver &amp; Ellwood (1920s)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1940/1970" type="inclusive">1940-1970</unitdate><container id="aspace_539206eead9caa80c5a8fe479adaca6d" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">531b</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref272_k4p" level="file"><did><unittitle>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube general notices and switch agreements; Republic Steel general notices and switch agreements; USS general notices; car reclaims; Penn Central correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1975" type="inclusive">1970-1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_b30f916b7c4d4297843b4f463196dc84" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">547b</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref273_cra" level="file"><did><unittitle>Freight car ownership logs; maintenance of equipment and freight cars; sale orders; leased car file; terminal building development; re- stenciled cars; car retirement sheets.

Included is the work of nationally known photo-documentarian David Plowden. These photographs contain information not only about the P&amp;LE, but also the various branch lines that, along with P&amp;LE, were controlled by the New York Central Railroad System (1883-1968), and later by Penn Central (1968-1970). Besides railroad information, many of the photographs are devoted to non-railroad activities and scenes. This sometimes incidental information is found in urban rural scenes predominantly in western Pennsylvania's Fayette, Washington, Allegheny, Beaver, and Lawrence counties, as well as in some of the bordering counties of West Virginia and Ohio.</p><p>The photographic formats represented in the collection are dry gelatin glass plate negatives, cellulose nitrate negatives, cellulose acetate, and 4x5 safety negatives. The images are universally of high quality both in terms of physical condition and aesthetic composition documenting industrial scenes along the railroad's rights of way as well as railroad facilities and equipment. The western Pennsylvania countryside is also featured in images taken for the proposed Lake Erie-Ohio River Canal in the 1940s. Also well represented are events such as river parades, celebrations in downtown Pittsburgh, as well as disaster such as wrecks and floods.</p><p>The Archives Service Center maintains an item level inventory of the photographic portion of the collection that is available for on-site review. The photographic images are arranged by date and image number assigned by the photographers.
