      <abstract id="aspace_a62e1c11b90866b6fc9795bca6ba5c32">The Western Pennsylvania Hospital was
        founded in 1848 with a mission to care for the poor who were ill and the insane of the
        Pittsburgh area. The hospital created a Department of the Insane, which was later relocated
        to Kilbuck Township and became known as Dixmont Hospital, while the main medical facility
        remained in the city of Pittsburgh. The records found here consist primarily of annual
        reports of these two institutions that shared a common board of managers for many decades
        but later became independent from each other. Digital reproductions of the reports in this
        collection are available online.</abstract>

      <p><title render="bold">Western Pennsylvania Hospital</title></p>
      <p>The Western Pennsylvania Hospital was incorporated in 1848 following three years of
        organizational meetings of Pittsburgh area citizens who were interested in establishing a
        facility to provide health care "for the reception and relief of lunatics, and the infirm,
        helpless, and sick poorâ€¦" (Wilson, page 9). It was the first public hospital chartered in
        Pittsburgh. Buildings were constructed on land donated by George Croghan and Harmar Denny in
        Pittsburgh's Ninth Ward (today's Polish Hill neighborhood). The hospital admitted its first
        patients in March 1853. During the early years, both patients with mental and physical
        illnesses were treated in the same facility. In 1862, the Department of the Insane was
        transferred to a newly constructed facility located in Kilbuck Township and became known as
        Dixmont. </p>
      <p>Not only did the Western Pennsylvania Hospital manage these two health care facilities,
        they were also responsible for the management of a philanthropic program, known as the
        "Brewer Fuel Fund." Charles Brewer came to Pittsburgh in 1817 and became a wealthy merchant
        before his death in 1860. In his will he provided funds to support many institutions in
        Pennsylvania. He also created a fund " . . . for supplying with fuel the destitute and
        worthy poor of Pittsburgh and vicinity." This fund is one of the earliest known
        philanthropic endowments in the Pittsburgh area. Following Charles Brewers example, several
        other endowment funds or trusts were set-up by donors and managed by the Western
        Pennsylvania Hospital through the early 20th century.</p>
      <p>During the American Civil War, the managers of the hospital provided facilities for the
        Federal government's Department of War for use as a soldier's hospital and home. The
        Pittsburgh Sanitary Fair, held from June 1 to June 20, 1864 raised funds that supported the
        soldier's facility. As many as 1,500 soldiers were treated at the facility per day. By 1871,
        the management and operations of the soldier's hospital and home was merged into Western
        Pennsylvania Hospital.</p>
      <p>Through the late 19th century, the Western Pennsylvania Hospital became home to the Western
        Pennsylvania Medical College (1883) and a School of Nursing (1892). By 1891, the medical
        school became affiliated with the Western University of Pennsylvania and it was eventually
        purchased and merged into the renamed University of Pittsburgh. The nursing program remains
        part of the hospital to this day (2014).</p>
      <p>When the facilities at the Polish Hill location became outdated and the health care field
        had changed from the treatment of the poor with ill health to the treatment of victims of
        industrial accidents, the hospital began planning for relocation. In 1912, a new facility
        was constructed on Friendship Avenue across the street from Friendship Park in the
        Bloomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. An enter wing of the new hospital was reserved for
        the Carnegie Steel Company and was staffed by company physicians and nurses.</p>
      <p>The Western Pennsylvania Hospital became known simply as "West Penn Hospital" in the 20th
        century as it became a leader in new forms of health care. In 1959, they opened the first
        intensive care unit in Pittsburgh and in 1971 they installed the first rooftop heliport in
        Pittsburgh for the transport of the critically ill and emergency services.</p>
      <p>In 1999, West Penn Health Systems purchased Allegheny General Hospital on Pittsburgh's
        North Side (including 3 other community facilities in western Pennsylvania) from the
        bankrupt Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF) to form the West Penn
        Allegheny Health Network (WPAHS). In 2013, Highmark was to acquire WPAHS and announced that
        it would be renamed the Allegheny Health Network.</p>
      <p><title render="bold">Dixmont Hospital</title></p>
      <p>Following the establishment of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in 1848, provisions were
        made for the care of the mentally ill. Under the guidance of Dorothea Dix, known throughout
        the United States for her advocacy in regard to the treatment of the mentally ill, a
        separate hospital facility was planned outside of the city limits on a 400+ acre tract of
        land in Kilbuck Township in 1859. The facility opened in 1862 and the train station and area
        surrounding the hospital became known as Dixmont, in honor of Ms. Dix. The facility was
        situated in a park like setting, with gardens, farms, and views of the Ohio River. By the
        late 19th century the facility housed between 1,200-1,500 patients.</p>
      <p>In 1907, the facility became independent of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital and became
        known as Dixmont Hospital for the Insane. With the changing responsibilities of the state
        government following the depression and the demand for better financial management of mental
        health institutions, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania took over ownership of the hospital in
        1946. It remained a mental hospital until July 1984 when it was closed due to the
        deinstitutionalization health care policies of state and federal governments that
        contributed to the decline in the number of patients. The approximate 300 remaining patients
        were transferred to other area facilities.</p>
      <p>While there were several efforts to save the campus of the Dixmont site, it was demolished
        in 2006 to make way for commercial development.</p>

      <p>The Western Pennsylvania Hospital and Dixmont Hospital records found in this collection
        consist primarily of annual reports of the Board of Managers. Typically the annual reports
        consist of a list of the members of the board of managers, officers, and staff; a list of
        committees and their members; written reports from the superintendents of the various
        departments of the hospital; report of the architect during the construction periods;
        information on items that were donated; and data concerning the patients, their origins and
        illnesses.</p>
      <p>Illustrations in the form of drawings, engravings, and photographs are also included
        throughout the annual reports. The reports dating from 1850 through the 1860s include
        detailed engravings of the hospital facilities and floor plans of several of the structures.
        Late 19th century and early 20th century reports include prints made from photographs of
        various exterior and interior views.</p>

          <p>The second series consists of Annual Reports that show individual reports for the
            various departments of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital. The superintendents of the
            Medical Department and Insane Department each have their own section and statistical
            tables included. Of special note, starting in 1865 a report for the Brewer Fuel Fund is
            also presented. By the 1880's other trust funds also emerge.</p>

          <p>The fourth series consists of broadsides, a minute book, and a rules book. The
            broadsides reflect two entertainment events that took place at the Dixmont facility. The
            rules and regulations book is also for the Dixmont facility. </p>
          <p>The minute book consists of twenty pages of meeting minutes of the Committee on City
            General Hospital, a committee of the Board of Managers of the Western Pennsylvania
            Hospital. Documented by the minutes are the decision to merge the Soldier's Home into
            the Western Pennsylvania Hospital facility in the 9th Ward of Pittsburgh and land
            acquisition agreements.</p>
