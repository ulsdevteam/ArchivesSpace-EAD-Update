    <abstract id="aspace_7627be3429ac1772e460e7d6a8174e1c">In May 1993 Dick Thornburgh returned to Washington, rejoining Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart as counsel in their Washington office.  That role has enabled Thornburgh to devote time to clients, and yet retain the opportunity to pursue outside interests and challenges which have been many and varied.  For example, his foreign trips include visits to Taiwan, Russia, and several to Hong Kong, regarding the rule of law. Trips to Guatemala (regarding governmental corruption), to Nigeria (regarding federalism, interstate relations and other governance issues), and to Buenos Aires (on fighting corruption) are also well documented. Other trips abroad concern his continued dedication to the rights of persons with disabilities.  Major challenges include, for example, his appointment as Examiner in the WorldCom bankruptcy proceedings, the largest ever filed, and his choice in 2004 by CBS to conduct an investigation into the "60 Minutes Wednesday" segment on President Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard. During the 1990s he embarked upon a new mini-career on television as a legal commentator on subjects such as the O.J. Simpson case, and President Clinton issues. One constructive by-product of the horrific September 11 attacks on the World Trade Towers was a review for the National Academy of Public Administration of FBI plans for reorganization, a task force that Thornburgh was asked to chair, and additional service as a member of the FBI Director's Advisory Board. Digital reproductions of portions of the collection are available <extref xlink:href="http://www.library.pitt.edu/thornburgh/">online</extref>.</abstract>

Although he survived several cuts, his final contribution to the matter was an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, in August 1994. Meanwhile, after scrutiny of alternatives, he decided to return, once again, to Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart as counsel in their Washington Office. That role has enabled Thornburgh to devote over half his time to clients, and yet retain the opportunity to pursue other outside interests developed over the years.</p><p>These interests have been many and varied, most of which are well documented in these files and frequently draw on Thornburgh's previous experience, both in government generally and at the United Nations in particular. A major topic, for example, has been the rule of law in developing countries and others emerging from Soviet domination. "If these nations were to see more democracy, respect for human rights and market-oriented economies ... the rule of law was an absolute sine qua non. Without it, free elections, corruption-free government and due process would be impossible ... Thus I became a veritable missionary for the rule of law" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 336). </p><p>The section here on foreign trips includes visits to Taiwan, Russia, and several to Hong Kong, all regarding the rule of law. Other trips to Guatemala (regarding governmental corruption), to Nigeria (regarding federalism, interstate relations and other governance issues), to Buenos Aires (on fighting corruption), are well documented here as well. In addition, other trips abroad concern his continued dedication to the rights of persons with disabilities, particularly in a return trip to Korea where Thornburgh and his wife, Ginny, discussed issues of religion and disability. "Our visit left us feeling that Korea had a long way to go in affording dignity to its citizens with disability, but we were heartened that so many people of goodwill, particularly within the religious communities, were trying to meet those challenges" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 346).</p><p>Other challenges presented themselves, for example, examination of World Bank's "mechanisms to deal with fraud and corruption connected with its lending" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 347), and involvement with civil justice reform, growing out of a report on the subject prepared by the Department of Justice in 1991 for the President's Council on Competitiveness. Thornburgh's interest in science and technology which dated back to the Ben Franklin Partnership of Governor days further took center stage from early to mid 1990s, and concern about product liability and caps on punitive damages are well expressed in his op-eds on the subject, all of which are available here online.</p><p>Also, during the 1990s, he "embarked upon a new mini-career as a television 'personality' ... The first call came on July 6, 1994, from the producer of Larry King Live, asking if [he] would consider a guest appearance that night to discuss some of the legal issues in the O.J. Simpson case ... One television appearance led to others; in total [he] appeared forty-five times on CNN to examine various aspects of the Simpson case" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 352). This led to further television appearances in connection with high-profile cases such as: murders of JonBenet Ramsey and Chandra Levy, President Clinton's "misadventures" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 353), and other appearances to discuss varying legal issues, over many years, on CNN's Late Edition, hosted by Wolf Blitzer. "Despite the sometimes long hours of preparation required to present accurate and well-informed views ... I must acknowledge that the whole process of offering views on matters of concern to the nation via the talk show circuit was most satisfying. It obliged me to keep on top of a variety of developments, and it was quite fulfilling to be asked my opinion on the issues of the day" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p. 357). Many of these appearances with Thornburgh's handwritten notes in preparation are represented in these files and are particularly intriguing.</p><p>Throughout these years Thornburgh has spoken around the country, frequently including a plea for involvement in public life.  What Thornburgh describes as his most comprehensive review of this subject is the Webb Lecture to the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) in November 1998, which is available here online. To this group he stated: "Democracy is not a spectator sport.  All of us must exercise the opportunity to contribute to improving and sustaining higher levels of performance in public life.</p><p>In the fall of 2002, Thornburgh was appointed examiner in WorldCom bankruptcy, the largest in American history, resulting from nearly $11 billion misreported revenues and expenditures.  The archive includes extensive documentation of this "massive task" and all three reports.</p><p>The files in this ongoing section of Dick Thornburgh's career are in the following subseries:  1) Speeches and Testimony; 2) Transcripts; 3) Foreign Trips; 4) Events; 5) Professional and Civic Work; 6) Media Interviews; 7) Correspondence; 8) Articles and Issues; 9) Where the Evidence Leads; 10) Varied Subjects of Interest; 11) Three Mile Island; and 12) Awards and Honors.</p><p>As Thornburgh continues his career more files are contributed to his archives ongoing. Stay tuned.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref10_bd7" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Speeches and Testimony</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9df3625491a862eb29565baccabb44b0"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Thornburgh's ongoing career, for archive purposes, began March 1993, just after his sojourn at the United Nations.  Since that time, up to and including April 2004 there were over 100 speeches and testimonies which have been digitized and are available here online.  In 2013 an additional 127 were added.</p><p>In some respects, there is no better way to recognize the diversity and substance of Thornburgh's career than in reviewing these speeches and testimonies.  There is a remarkably broad array of topics which relate to his many ongoing interests and commitments, for example: human rights, drug and alcohol abuse, business crime, rule of law, partnerships in science and technology, law enforcement, United Nations, merit selection for judges, civil justice reform, health care, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), war against terrorism, disability and civil rights, Three Mile Island, crises in corporate America, WorldCom bankruptcy, and World Bank investigation. These were delivered, just for example, before Committees of Congress, at Graduations, at the Vatican Conference on Drug and Alcohol Abuse, to colleges and universities, bar associations, Chambers of Commerce and United Nations events.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref11_e1k" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vatican Conference on Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Rome, Italy</unittitle><unitdate

These clearly derive from Thornburgh's outstanding career and the esteem with which he is regarded.</p><p>The majority of the foreign trips were organized to monitor the elections in newly democratic countries, such as Ukraine, Russia, Nigeria, Hong Kong, and Cambodia. These trips were organized primarily by two organizations-the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI). The mission of both is similar and well summarized in the mission statement found on the IRI website: a "dedicat[ion] to advancing democracy, freedom, self-government and the rule of law worldwide." Thornburgh's personal commitment to the promotion of democracy and Rule of Law worldwide are clearly represented in the election and pre-election observation missions, the "Good Governance" conferences in Guatemala, and the Rule of Law mission to Russia.</p><p>There are several other trips where Thornburgh was invited to be a featured speaker. These include his trip to Lisbon, Portugal, to participate in the USIA U.S. Speakers Program, and his trip with Ginny on the Radisson Seven Seas Cruise Tour of Brazil, during which he was the featured "celebrity speaker."</p><p>Dick and Ginny Thornburgh's exceptional commitment to disability issues also relate to two trips in particular, both sponsored by the Education and Rehabilitation Exchange Foundation (EREF). Both of these trips were to the Republic of Korea (South Korea). These demonstrate the couple's unwavering commitment to advocating and improving the conditions and treatment of disabled persons worldwide. Especially meaningful is a reprint of an article, included in the files, written by Ginny Thornburgh and published in Guideposts magazine, entitled, "For the Love of Peter."</p><p>The Thornburghs also enjoyed two trips sponsored by the Princeton Theological Seminary (PTS), for which Ginny serves as a member of the Board of Trustees. In 2000, Ginny asked Dick on the PTS information sheet regarding the Holy Land-Jerusalem trip if they could go for her 60th birthday, which they did. Three years later, she reciprocated with an encircled paragraph on the French Reformation trip in the PTS newsletter wishing her husband "Happy birthday!" The material for these trips is mostly "touristy" and reflects their personal enjoyment.</p><p>The foreign trip files are organized by destination, with the countries most visited (Russia, Hong Kong, Korea) first, and all singular trips to countries following. The reasoning for a non-chronological order for the trips derives from Thornburgh's inevitable in-depth preparation prior to and subsequent to visiting a country. This is particularly significant when he had occasion to visit a country more than once. For example, Thornburgh visited Russia in 1993, 1995, and 1996. Yet he monitored and collected news clippings and articles each year from 1991-1997. For that reason, all the Russia trip files appear first, with a subsequent "news clippings" and "publications and journals" section. The "single-visit" trips are arranged in chronological order.</p><p>The Ongoing Career foreign trips and related files are arranged as follows: 1) International Republican Institute (IRI) Russian Election Monitoring Mission, December 7-15, 1993; 2) Trip to Russia, October 24, 1995; 3) International Republican Institute (IRI) Russian Election Monitoring Mission, June 10-18, 1996; 4) Russia news

His commitment over several years to this  issue was significant and important.  Liu Xiaobo was imprisoned largely due to the authorities' suspicion that he was an organizer of Charter O8, a declaration that outlines a vision for a more democratic China. Ultimately Liu was sentenced to prison for 10 years despite the significant efforts of notable lawyers and political figures in US, such as Dick Thornburgh.</p></scopecontent><c05

In this portion of the collection the researcher will find the speeches he gave at the many different speaking engagements, and interviews with a variety of interviewers ranging from the student writing an article to national media. Thornburgh continues to focus upon his strong interests and commitments, which are evident in the events, particularly white-collar crime, testimony given on the subject of terrorism, narcotics and foreign relations, and the American Disabilities Act (ADA) to name a few. This section is arranged in chronological order by date of event.</p><p>There is a second group of events that are grouped by year. There are several events within each year, primarily those for which there is only a minimal amount of information.

Estimates that as much as 25 percent of its funding found its way into pockets of corrupt officials eventually were recognized by the bank as a great concern rather than merely "political" reality. Thornburgh with the help of some former associates from the Department of Justice and the United Nations learned about the culture of the bank and figured out methods to address the problem. The resulting report delivered in early 2000 recommended a new Office of Institutional Integrity which was up and running within months. They continued to act as consultants to the bank on the implementation of the recommendations.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_ref760_z12" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence re Thornburgh and anti-corruption work for World Bank</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">August 20-December 22, 1999</unitdate><container id="aspace_867acf4e8ae261891a9913512dc272d4" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1014</container><container id="aspace_3f5fef181b9af94d3801f4796bfdefe3" parent="aspace_867acf4e8ae261891a9913512dc272d4" type="folder">1</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref803_hzr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memo: Zhang (Chair WB Oversight Committee on Fraud &amp;

"My job was to carry out an independent investigation into what happened in the WorldCom matter and to assure Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzales that procedures and persons involved in any past wrongdoing were not carried forward into any reorganized entity… and finally to make recommendations to aid in avoiding repetition elsewhere of the acts that caused the downfall of WorldCom" (Evidence, p. 363).  The three committee reports over several years place major responsibility for WorldCom's collapse on the members of the board of directors, especially those who served on its audit and compensation committees.  Major officials involved in the fraud were convicted in federal court.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_ref1015_x5y" level="file"><did><unittitle>First Interim Report of Thornburgh, Bankruptcy Court Examiner</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">November 4, 2002</unitdate><container id="aspace_a91b0b6817c948eb19dd7893d5d573b1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1019</container><container id="aspace_6f73b1628ec2975c585931b67e99f1a9" parent="aspace_a91b0b6817c948eb19dd7893d5d573b1" type="folder">1</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1016_o94" level="file"><did><unittitle>First Interim Report of Thornburgh, Bankruptcy Court Examiner (Thornburgh annotations)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">November 4, 2002</unitdate><container id="aspace_c62c39f44b06570615bf19311b0bc3d5" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1019</container><container id="aspace_b2656f2935232808a52021743df6e1b5" parent="aspace_c62c39f44b06570615bf19311b0bc3d5" type="folder">2</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1017_v2b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memoranda and notes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">February-April 2003</unitdate><container id="aspace_a3a7ccc0846acfe59c67d1f1d64304b4" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1019</container><container id="aspace_a416c089fcc08ac83e81b543c7155fbf" parent="aspace_a3a7ccc0846acfe59c67d1f1d64304b4" type="folder">3</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1018_gqf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Emails regarding WorldCom</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">November 2003</unitdate><container id="aspace_f161961c1df646d8b0089dc8731da4c2" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1019</container><container id="aspace_041e612c473fc71910e910935f2548d0" parent="aspace_f161961c1df646d8b0089dc8731da4c2" type="folder">4</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1019_9ay" level="file"><did><unittitle>Second Interim Report</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">June 9, 2003</unitdate><container id="aspace_9bb034ab040aa912e1def952223f04f9" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1019</container><container id="aspace_fa01f536088bc8e31072b7e96e282c8d" parent="aspace_9bb034ab040aa912e1def952223f04f9" type="folder">5</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1020_6nj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Second Interim Report (Thornburgh annotations)</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">June 9, 2003</unitdate><container id="aspace_156b02feefc501a6fe74ec959931cbe1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1019</container><container id="aspace_a2dcd37cfeb91649be140cf6e0c018c7" parent="aspace_156b02feefc501a6fe74ec959931cbe1" type="folder">6</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1021_obw" level="file"><did><unittitle>"302 Interviews"</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">ca.

These included the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other regulations to avoid similar instances of corporate corruption.  This section relates to relationships between corporations and their lawyers, and responsibilities, compensation, and liabilities of boards of directors. Thornburgh ultimately concluded that ethical conduct of corporate affairs would make more difference than all the laws and regulations and spoke often and wrote articles to this effect.

He asked if Thornburgh would undertake an independent investigation with Associated Press CEO Lou Boccardi into preparation of the September 8 broadcast relating to the Texas Air National Guard Service of President George W. Bush, and public statements by CBS News following and defending the segment. This was extremely sensitive due to the proximity of the 2004 presidential election so work began immediately. The investigation revealed serious shortcomings. Ultimately Dan Rather relinquished his anchor position on the CBS Evening News and Mary Mapes and other senior individuals were terminated and/or resigned.

Mueller asked Thornburgh in August 2005 to serve on the FBI Director's Advisory Board which had  been authorized by Congress in February 2003 to independently advise the Director on matters relating to science, technology, research and other matters of special interest to the FBI. Also the transformation panel recommendations were seen as critical to put in place. Thornburgh served on the board 2005-2011.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_ref1205_0fn" level="file"><did><unittitle>Binder: Director's Advisory board meeting</unittitle><unitdate

be a member of the Terrorism Task Force in October 2001. The purposes were to identify issues where careful thought is required and that occur in early days of a great crisis. Major issues for the task force were to relate to an International/National Agenda, Homeland Security, and US &amp; World Economy. Thornburgh was a member briefly October 2001 into fall 2002, when other significant challenges for him ensued.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_ref1345_l89" level="file"><did><unittitle>Task Force

contributing to economic development was initiated in the establishment of the Ben Franklin Partnership while Governor of Pennsylvania (1979-1987).  It became a national model for Government-Industry-University cooperation in technology transfer.  In September 1993 former Ohio Governor Dick Celeste and Thornburgh co-chaired a colloquium to establish federal-state cooperation in science and technology, which was attended by representatives of all 50 states plus relevant federal agencies.  They  subsequently co-chaired a twenty member State-Federal Task Force on Science and Technology in 1995 to make recommendations on structuring and implementing a partnership effort. Thornburgh travelled across the country to promote the concepts and conclusions in the report.  Later Thornburgh chaired a study commissioned by the National Research Council, travelling widely to promote support for its recommendations.  With the ongoing  financial support of the Carnegie Corporation a non-profit State Science and Technology Institute was ultimately established.  Thornburgh became its first Board Chairman and served until the end of 2002.  There are extensive files here on this subject.</p></scopecontent><c05 id="aspace_ref2525_4w7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Meeting with Iowa Governor Branstad</unittitle><unitdate

Thornburgh, of course, as a political figure, had much experience appearing as guest on network news shows, but the 1990s explosion of twenty-four-hour-a-day news networks, such as FOX News, CNN, CNBC, etc., drastically increased the news shows and their coverage.</p><p>He first received a phone call from the producer of CNN's "Larry King Live" show on July 6, 1994, requesting Thornburgh to appear on the show to discuss some of the legal implications of the O.J. Simpson case, which was already promising to become a huge media blitz of both analysis and hype over the next year and a half, until a verdict would be reached. Thornburgh writes, "I was about to become engrossed in 'the trial of the century'" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p.352). Thornburgh and two others became "regulars" regarding the trial, Thornburgh consistently interpreting the actual legal issues involved. Thornburgh had occasion during the months of the trial to advocate and argue for several improvements to the criminal justice system, including the "removal of racist policemen like Mark Fuhrman from police forces across America; closer scrutiny by prosecutors on the background of all witnesses ... judicial appointment of scientific experts to replace highly paid, partisan 'hired guns' engaged in scientific swearing contests; restrictions on the number of lawyers permitted to participate on either side" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p.352) and other issues. Thornburgh also dealt with the hot debate topic of camera surveillance in courtrooms, but found himself in the minority of those in favor, noting Judge Lance Ito's courtroom during the trial little different that the venues in which Thornburgh had tried cases-"Barely perceptible cameras unobtrusively recorded the proceedings" (<title xlink:type="simple">Evidence</title>, p.353).</p><p>His successful, and highly regarded appearances on CNN resulted in a number of opportunities to host the show after the Simpson trial, when King took the night off. These gave him an opportunity to examine legal aspects of other high-profile criminal cases such as Gotti and the Unabomber, as well as varied topics such as elections, DNA evidence and wrongful convictions, Bosnia and Ireland, and gubernatorial issues of economic development and welfare reform. Thornburgh also appeared on other shows, such as CNN's "Burden of Proof" and CNN's "Late Edition," hosted by Wolf Blitzer.</p><p>These files are organized as follows: 1) Thornburgh's show appearances on CNN's "Larry King Live," as host as well as panelist. These files include Ginny Thornburgh's notes, Thornburgh's notes in preparation, and some post-analysis, and background research; 2) Thornburgh's show appearances on other CNN programs; 3) Thornburgh's files on the O.J. Simpson case, including notes, correspondence, materials relating to Thornburgh's "Larry King Live" appearances and work, and other files of Thornburgh on the case; 4) Newswires, clippings, and journal articles regarding O.J. Simpson and related cases. </p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref695_zya" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Thornburgh's Appearances on CNN's "Larry King Live," including as host</unittitle></did><c04 id="aspace_ref696_pmg" level="file"><did><unittitle>Regarding O.J.

note</head><p>The articles and news clippings here reflect the attention given to Dick Thornburgh's ongoing career, with Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, and also working with a number of public policy organizations, just for example.  His advice was sought by World Bank and governmental officials in developing nations, and others. Some of these articles and files relate to the WorldCom investigation and bankruptcy, pornography, terrorism, disability matters, and civil justice reform, and also regarding Ginny Thornburgh and her ongoing work in the disability field.  They reflect the multi-dimensional aspects of Thornburgh's continuing career and counsel sought from him on major topics of the day, as well as even the prospect of becoming Baseball Commissioner.</p><p>An additional section, added in 2013, pertains to President Clinton's "misadventures," particularly confusing legal matters relating to the issue of Independent Counsel. There is other information on this subject in the Media Interviews subseries.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref734_z3k" level="file"><did><unittitle>About Dick Thornburgh, including Baseball
