    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Eugene F. Premru (1911-1998) lived with his wife Evalyn (n√©e Swedie) (d. 2000) in Bellevue, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, until his induction into the military in 1943. During his basic training and early service he was stationed in Maryland, New Orleans, and Ohio. In 1944 he was sent to Europe and worked in the 141st Hospital Train Maintenance Detachment, serving in England, France, and Belgium. While enlisted he was promoted from Private First Class to Technician Fifth Grade.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>This collection is a record of Eugene F. Premru's experiences in the military during World War II and his correspondence during that time period with his wife, family, and friends. In addition to approximately 300 letters, the collection contains approximately 100 photographs, ephemera, and miscellaneous items relating to the time period. Correspondence is dated 1939 thru 1945 and arranged in chronological order. The primary correspondents are Premru and his wife, Evalyn. Premru's letters talk about friends and relatives who have been called to service, living conditions of soldiers in the barracks, his daily routines and training, frustration with mail service, concern about his wife's health, and general loneliness and homesickness. His wife's letters mention civilian concerns such as rationing and news of the war, financial difficulties, family matters and news, and her job as a hairdresser. A letter from August 1945 gives a vivid account of V.J. Day in Pittsburgh. Documents, ephemera, and photographs are arranged by format. Most documents are military service records and the ephemera are mostly souvenir items from his time in Europe. Two items are personal documents of German soldiers: a private diary and a military passbook.</p>  </scopecontent>

Premru and Evalyn Premru from 1939 to 1945, arranged in chronological order. Correspondence from 1939 through 1941 predates Premru's years of military service. Some letters contain clippings, greeting cards, or other items. Photocopies have been made of some of the fragile items. Also included are approximately 100 V-mail letters written during Premru's tour of duty in Europe from 1944 to 1945. V-mail ("Victory mail") was a type of correspondence used by the armed services to reduce the volume of mail shipped overseas. Correspondence was written on a V-mail letter-sheet and then reduced photostatically to microfilm for shipment. At a receiving station, a facsimile of the V-mail was reproduced from the microfilm at approximately one-quarter of the size of the original letter-sheet; this facsimile was sent to the addressee. Recipient copies of V-mails in this collection have been reproduced as enlarged acid-free photocopies and filed chronologically with the other correspondence. Undated correspondence (letters and photocopies of V-mail) is filed at the end of the correspondence.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref16_aty" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">December 1939 - April 1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_347c7b1f638e3d6d9e29f02706b9f630" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_4056979cc36cf9a343fb7da2329b38b9" parent="aspace_347c7b1f638e3d6d9e29f02706b9f630" type="folder">1-10</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref17_g3j" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">April 1945 - [December 1945]</unitdate><container id="aspace_32e69f88388ca35bcfef20c95915a04c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_6a95ccc1b35ce6135e947de9b7263ec3" parent="aspace_32e69f88388ca35bcfef20c95915a04c" type="folder">1-7</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref18_p0w" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence - undated</unittitle><container id="aspace_37daa93f3ba2b6846e3ce36657461ea2" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_732da4746e001ff455df5991782baa99" parent="aspace_37daa93f3ba2b6846e3ce36657461ea2" type="folder">8</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref19_7ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence: photocopies of V-mail - undated</unittitle><container id="aspace_312497ad5c9d33f83d7afd1128fcf0b5" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_d974f203dbd82c790ba5335b918928c1" parent="aspace_312497ad5c9d33f83d7afd1128fcf0b5" type="folder">9</container></did></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref14_ioa" level="series"><did><unittitle>Government documents, ephemera, and photographs (personal snapshots)</unittitle><unitid>II.</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ea4fc798e5f0e65b05345e69bd158f45"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>Materials are arranged by format and are not in original order. Official documents pertain to military service. Examples include, but are not limited to, immunization record, pay record, induction notice, Paris off-base pass, and Paris assignment card.
