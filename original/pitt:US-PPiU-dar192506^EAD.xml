    <head>Biography</head>
<p>The last quarter of the eighteenth century saw the formation of the United States government after the end of the Revolutionary War. Constitutional ratification, following the 1787 Constitutional Convention, was a tremendously contentious issue, as were issues of foreign policy surrounding the 1795 Jay Treaty with Britain, the 1796 Pinckney Treaty with Spain, and the Treaty of Tripoli. Westward expansion created significant legal questions about land ownership, development, and taxation, while Indian wars raged from the 1780s to the 1790s. Unrest over the excise tax on whiskey that swept through the American frontier came to a head in western Pennsylvania in 1794.</p><p>The papers of Alexander Addison address most of these major happenings in post-revolutionary America. Born in Scotland, Addison (1758-1807) received his Master of Arts from Aberdeen University at age nineteen. He subsequently trained as a minister, and was admitted by the Presbytery of Aberlowe in 1781. However, upon immigrating to the newly independent America in 1785, the Redstone Presbytery in western Pennsylvania refused to license Addison as a minister. As an alternative, he apprenticed as a lawyer and was later admitted to the Washington County, Pennsylvania, bar in 1787. Addison started his legal career as an itinerant lawyer. When Addison began practicing law, many of the judges and justices of the peace were men without formal education in law who were appointed by the state executive. However, the 1790 State Constitution required each district court to be headed by a President Judge educated in the law. In 1791, Addison was appointed the president judge of the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, which included all of western Pennsylvania. For thirteen years Addison presided over the nascent Fifth District when both state and federal laws were being written and little legal precedent existed.</p><p>During the Whiskey Rebellion, Addison upheld the authority of state and federal law. In 1802, he was impeached from the bench as a result of ongoing and politically motivated conflict with fellow Justice John B. C. Lucas. Addison published various political tracts many of which are now available in digitized form. His papers trace extended correspondence with three notable men of Pennsylvania, each highlighting a different type of relationship and set of i nterests and issues detailed below. Addison died in 1807.</p><p>Charles Nisbet (1736-1803) was born in Scotland and educated at the University of Edinburgh and Divinity Hall. He served as a minister for various Scottish congregations. He was recruited by Dickenson College, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and became Principal there on July 5, 1785. A respected scholar, Nisbet was deeply committed to traditional Scottish-style university education and the ministry. He was consistently disappointed with what he viewed as an American disrespect for authority and tradition.</p><p>William Findley (1741/1742-1821) immigrated to Philadelphia in 1763. He was politically active at the state and federal level. Between 1789 and 1791 he variously served Pennsylvania in the General Assembly, the State Supreme Executive Council, the State House of Representatives, and the State Constitutional Convention. For the duration of 1791 through 1799 he served as an Anti-Administration and later as a Republican candidate in the second through fourth congresses. During this time, Findley worked to quiet the Whiskey Rebellion. Following his time as a federal congressman, Findley served in the Pennsylvania State Senate from 1799 to 1802. He was successfully elected back to the House of Representatives, as a Republican, in the eighth through fourteenth Congresses. </p><p>Hugh Henry Brackenridge (1748-1816) was a well-known lawyer, newspaper publisher and political agitator in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Born in York County, Pennsylvania, he attended college and Divinity School at Princeton. Following his service as a chaplain in the Revolutionary War, he moved to Pittsburgh and was admitted to the Allegheny Country Bar with Alexander Addison and John Woods. After his mixed role in the Whiskey Rebellion and a failed U.S. congressional race against Albert Gallatin, he was appointed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Throughout his life, Brackenridge wrote and published the Pittsburgh <title xlink:type="simple">Gazette</title>, and penned a number of books, most notably his multiple editions of <title xlink:type="simple">Modern Chivalry</title>. He started his family in Pittsburgh and had four children, Henry Marie who went on to fame in government service, Cornelia, William, and Alexander Brackenridge. He later moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he continued to conduct affairs in Pittsburgh until his death.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>This collection of correspondence contains long runs of letters from newspaper publisher Hugh Henry Brackenridge and from the Reverend Charles Nisbet of Dickinson College, and a short run of letters from Congressman William Findley. Addison, Brackenridge, Nisbet and Findley were all educated men of Pennsylvania. To Addison, Brackenridge was a fellow lawyer and writer. Nisbet was Addison's friend and a fellow Scottish theologian. Findley's relationship to Addison is less clear, although they both worked to quiet the Whiskey Rebellion. The bulk of the correspondence relates to the time and place in which they were written. All correspondents mention constitution ratification and early congressional events. Brackenridge writes repeatedly about the Jay Treaty and Pinckney Treaty. Brackenridge also references events surrounding the Whiskey Rebellion, and writes about his political enemy, Albert Gallatin, a federalist and foil to Alexander Hamilton's fiscal policy. Brackenridge provides editorial feedback on Addison's political tracts and essays. Findley's few letters detail events in the House of Representatives. Nisbet's letters are the most colorful, and touch upon the broadest range of domestic and foreign issues, most notably his openly sarcastic hostility towards post-revolutionary politics, both American and French. Nisbet also corresponds extensively with Addison about deeply personal problems related to Nisbet's alcoholic son. </p><p>Names of people and events that are inferred, rather than explicitly stated in the correspondence, are bracketed in the item level scope content notes. The majority of the correspondence includes typed transcriptions, which are filed with the original letters. Address information within the correspondence varies and is noted at the item level when known. </p>  </scopecontent>

This run of letters is a political discussion between two legal and literary peers. Addison published a number of political works from 1796 to 1798. Brackenridge comments on a variety of political issues, including his opposition to the Jay Treaty with Britain and the Monroe-Pinckney Treaty with Spain, as well as events related to the Whiskey Rebellion. Also, Brackenridge makes references to Albert Gallatin, who defeated him in the 1795 congressional race. Brackenridge discusses Addison's political writings as both an editor and as a fellow writer. Conflict arose between the two men in September 1798 when Brackenridge published a piece in the Pittsburgh <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Gazette</title> that affected Addison personally, professionally and politically. In 1802, Brackenridge's friend, John B. C. Lucas, was appointed to the Fifth District court. Conflict between Lucas and Addison led to Addison's subsequent impeachment.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref16_1e9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hugh Henry Brackenridge to Alexander Addison</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">January 7, 1796</unitdate><container id="aspace_13fcbf037a238b4af9d2f122560b527e" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_3181c5ae6a8951e874297e0991c8fbe0" parent="aspace_13fcbf037a238b4af9d2f122560b527e" type="folder">1</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="31735061277418" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Hugh Henry Brackenridge to Alexander Addison" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Hugh Henry Brackenridge to Alexander Addison: January 7, 1796</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a0322ccaa344a3a467da8157342c2b43"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>In this letter, Brackenridge writes about legal cases and Judge Smith.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref18_hqv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hugh Henry Brackenridge to Alexander Addison</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">February 15, 1796</unitdate><container id="aspace_d5a0a969531f332c3be7639352f08f4d" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_62f467cdf7515e894e83721f618a657b" parent="aspace_d5a0a969531f332c3be7639352f08f4d" type="folder">2</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="31735061277459" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Hugh Henry Brackenridge to Alexander Addison" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Hugh Henry Brackenridge to Alexander Addison: February 15, 1796</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_24ed8ac377c31980e078cc417b3622df"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Brackenridge discusses a letter of [Jean] Fauchet and a proposed treaty.

His letters from 1786 to 1795 are steeped in Nisbet's colorfully articulated and overwhelmingly negative view of revolutionary politics. Nisbet's common complaint that the world had gone "liberty-mad" extends to American politics, Revolutionary and post-revolutionary France, and his professional frustrations as Principal of Dickenson College. Some of Nisbet's comments about the French may be related to John B. C. Lucas, the French-born Fifth District judge whose actions precipitated Addison's impeachment in 1802. Nisbet critiques them all with a sense of humor. A number of significant events are addressed in the letters, including; the progress of the French Revolution and its impact on Europe and the Americas; the Northwest Indian War led by General "Mad" Anthony Wayne; the Chickamauga Wars with a branch of the Cherokee Nation in the South; African slave revolts in the French Caribbean; unproven bribery allegations against Secretary of State Edmund Randolph; the early Federal Congresses; and the Whiskey Rebellion. Nisbet revels in pointing out hypocrisy and inconsistency in American and French politics. However, the correspondence takes a very personal turn in 1797 when Nisbet's son moves to Washington County to live with Addison. Between 1797 and his death in 1803, Nisbet and his wife tried desperately, with Addison's help, to deal with their son's descent into alcoholism and debt.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref81_1vr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Charles Nisbet to Alexander Addison</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">January 26, 1786</unitdate><container id="aspace_5316ac6523a2785552af1954f2fa31ea" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_fad07b5ebd0246ea3f800d68bb3f5555" parent="aspace_5316ac6523a2785552af1954f2fa31ea" type="folder">32</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="31735061277392" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Charles Nisbet to Alexander Addison" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Charles Nisbet to Alexander Addison: January 26, 1786</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_af457bd09b6ba36e8780ef768028c428"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Nisbet confirms the receipt of Addison's letter and acknowledges Addison's relocation to Pittsburgh.
