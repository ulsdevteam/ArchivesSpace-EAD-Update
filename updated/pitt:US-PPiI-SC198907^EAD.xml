    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Fred Rogers (1928-2003) was an American television personality and host of <title render="italic">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</title>. He was born March 20, 1928 in Latrobe, Pa., and graduated from Latrobe High School in 1946. He studied at Dartmouth College from 1946-1948 until he transferred to Rollins College in Winter Park, Fl., where he earned his BA in music in 1951 (he wrote over 200 songs for <emph render="italic">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</emph>). At Rollins College he met his wife, Sarah Joanne Byrd, a pianist. They married in 1952 and had two sons: James in 1959 and John in 1961. During the early 1950's he worked in New York City for NBC's musical programs,<title render="italic">Your Hit Parade</title>,<title render="italic">The Kate Smith Hour</title>, and<title render="italic">The Voice of Firestone</title>. After leaving NBC, he moved to Pittsburgh and worked as a puppeteer for the Pittsburgh public television station (WQED) children's show,<title render="italic">The Children's Corner</title>, hosted by Josie Carey. During his seven years with the program, he developed puppets (many of which he also voice acted), characters, and music — including King Friday XIII and X the Owl. While working on<title render="italic">The Children's Corner</title>, he studied theology at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and in 1963 was ordained a minister of the United Presbyterian Church. At his ordination, the Presbyterian Church asked him to serve children and families through television.  </p><p>In 1963, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) asked Rogers to develop the program, <title render="italic">Mister Rogers</title>. Rogers moved to Toronto where the show ran for three seasons. In 1966, he received the rights to the program and moved the show to WQED in Pittsburgh. On February 19, 1968, distribution of the <emph render="italic">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</emph> began and in 1970 the show moved to PBS. In 1971, Rogers formed the non-profit production company Family Communications Inc. (now known as Fred Rogers Productions). </p><p><emph render="italic">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</emph> ran for 895 episodes, from 1968-2001. In 1997 he accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 24th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. 
 
Rogers was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2002 and passed away the following year.  His wife, Joanne Rogers, a professional duo-concert pianist and dedicated philanthropist, continues to live in Pittsburgh where she works to preserve his legacy. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>This collection contains materials related to the popular children's television show <title render="italic">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</title> (which is referred to as MRN throughout the finding aid), which was created by Fred Rogers and aired from 1968 to 2001. This collection does not focus on the personal life of Fred Rogers; rather, it focuses on Rogers' life work to promote the well-being of children through the show MRN, as well as Rogers' other projects. Ways that Fred Rogers performed this work outside of the Neighborhood included producing non-MRN television programs, writing articles about children, giving speeches, and creating materials for parents and daycare providers to utilize. Some of the materials in this collection were produced by Family Communications, Inc., Fred Rogers' production group.</p><p>The bulk of material in this collection concerns the producing and promoting of MRN during the 1970 to 1990 period. These materials include publicity photographs, press kits, scripts, and episode summaries and records. This collection also contains materials that analyze the impact and cultural value of MRN. There are few original documents written by Rogers himself. Other highlights of this collection include fan mail, photographs which viewers sent in to Rogers, a script from the special about the Kennedy assassination, and Yo-Yo Ma and Jeanne Marie Laskas' contributions to a University of Pittsburgh Press book about MRN. </p><p>Please note that we do not have access to A/V materials. Episodes of MRN can be purchased from Amazon.com.</p><p>The 15 MRN puppets donated with this collection are on permanent loan to the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. Those puppets are: Ana Platypus, Cornflake S. Pecially, Daniel Striped Tiger, Dr. Bill Platypus, Edgar Cooke, Elsie Jean Platypus, Grandpere, Harriet Elizabeth Cow, Henrietta Pussycat, King Friday XIII, Lady Elaine Fairchilde, Prince Tuesday (adolescent), Prince Tuesday (baby), Queen Sara Saturday, and X the Owl.</p>  </scopecontent>

Some topics Fred Rogers touches on in his articles are child safety, back to school, children and TV, celebrating Christmas with your child, and understanding children's needs.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref77_dvm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461023</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1968/1979" type="inclusive">1968-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_f94e41923477b63ec02945436eba1ed8" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_5707a78bda3ed69e8ad0ab9ba2f86118" parent="aspace_f94e41923477b63ec02945436eba1ed8" type="folder">11</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref78_az8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461024</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1986/1989" type="inclusive">1986-1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_7ac30f9f308036dd8973a1a2512e83ab" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_227dc4e864808832dd656e0c4463cd9f" parent="aspace_7ac30f9f308036dd8973a1a2512e83ab" type="folder">12</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref79_yze" level="file"><did><unittitle>Articles</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461025</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1997/2002" type="inclusive">1997-2002</unitdate><container id="aspace_d616bb09aab22090bcefb64f0dcf9351" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_2b35f4f1fe10d001dfe2d64afb644e3a" parent="aspace_d616bb09aab22090bcefb64f0dcf9351" type="folder">13</container></did></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref16_vfa" level="series"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitid>IV.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461026</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1992" type="inclusive">1971-1992</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_707e4b921b4878be4cf3a18a7531e1aa"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>This series contains letters written to Fred Rogers from the viewers of <emph render="italic">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</emph>, and other correspondence.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_65151d07157b7d48a645be1a51e0569a"><head>Access Restrictions</head><p>The materials in Series IV.

Almost all are candid or school portraits of children, but there are some photos of adults, too. Many have inscriptions on the backs of the photos. The photos were originally formatted in scrapbook-like photo albums, and there are remnants of the decorations and categorization. A note states that the contents have been removed from the original scrapbook for preservation purposes. It is unclear who created the photo albums, or whether they were ever a gift to Fred Rogers. Some sections appear to be themed. It is also unclear whether the photos were solicited (send in a picture of yourself doing…) or completely voluntary. The beginning folders seem to be mostly school portraits, and the later folders appear to be themed. Original organization has tried to be preserved where indication of organization is given.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref124_xux" level="file"><did><unittitle>Album #1</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461065</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1988/1988" type="inclusive">1988</unitdate><container id="aspace_f9b8d6454b8718afd633271d58697486" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_315ca6b8b7cb6804c1f81f43baa31c8a" parent="aspace_f9b8d6454b8718afd633271d58697486" type="folder">23-24</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref126_h30" level="file"><did><unittitle>Album #2</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461066</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989" type="inclusive">1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_4b197c9bd6e21f3663960516b55da02b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_b45121e282b90c37d0fb66e130dd3cc2" parent="aspace_4b197c9bd6e21f3663960516b55da02b" type="folder">25</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref127_vjj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Album #2</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461067</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989" type="inclusive">1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_959083ce2ab066f33e3b83463ffaf09d" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_48d6fb0fc921456d049ff7e905dc68bc" parent="aspace_959083ce2ab066f33e3b83463ffaf09d" type="folder">1-7</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref28_fv2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Other projects</unittitle><unitid>3.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461068</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1987/1992" type="inclusive">1987-1992</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_25de9d517e4a568cc4c88f8e54ae5fe5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries contains photographs from <title render="italic">Old Friends, New Friends</title>,<title render="italic">Mister Rogers Talks with Parents…</title> and Fred Rogers' visits to schoolchildren.

songs, props and art, and other information from shooting that episode. Scripts are mostly typewritten, but a few folders contain handwritten notes and/or script additions on separate pieces of paper—some appear to be in Fred Rogers' handwriting. Some scripts also have handwritten edits and notes on them. The Kennedy Assassination special was aired after the death of Robert F. Kennedy.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref268_fcb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Completion Schedule</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461192</unitid><unitdate

In 1996, the University of Pittsburgh Press published the first book to analyze the life and work of Fred Rogers and the impact of his show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Work on the book began in 1992, and the book was published in 1996 under the title <title render="italic">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood: Children, Television, and Fred Rogers</title>. The editors of the book were Mark Collins and Margaret Mary Kimmel, with Fred Hetzl and Catherine Marshall of the University Press also overseeing the work. The final result included participation from seventeen contributors for a total of fifteen essays. Notable participants include Jeanne Marie Laskas and Yo-Yo Ma. The materials offer a pretty comprehensive overview of the creation of the book, except that the last dated materials are from 1994, and the book was published in 1996.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref103_rjf" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Planning</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461280</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1994" type="inclusive">1974-1994</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_605ed37656366699209934532374529b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries contains documents from the early stages of development on the book. Many have handwritten notes from the editors, along with official typewritten documents. The main points of focus in these documents are choosing contributors to write articles, matching contributors with appropriate topics they could write on, and surveying literature already written on similar topics, particularly if it already mentioned Fred Rogers or Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The Miscellaneous folder contains what appears to be the first memo written about the project dated 1990, and a calendar outlining the main stages of development.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref277_9wh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Choosing contributors</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461281</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_10280185f72403a6c296cb2ab35a26a0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_ed1aaad5d1f25232645d8cce5c2aa5ae" parent="aspace_10280185f72403a6c296cb2ab35a26a0" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref278_inh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Literature search, bibliographic records</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461282</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1994" type="inclusive">1992-1994</unitdate><container id="aspace_a08bcd961907d155cbe1de96884ddf5a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_2bc878fe9121402cd7648145948e6253" parent="aspace_a08bcd961907d155cbe1de96884ddf5a" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref279_rby" level="file"><did><unittitle>Literature search, sample articles, B-H</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461283</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1990" type="inclusive">1974-1990</unitdate><container id="aspace_d81d8c93493d794d7eb2a146529a0a56" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_074bfbb5b43e8221ee9797d0ba535f4b" parent="aspace_d81d8c93493d794d7eb2a146529a0a56" type="folder">4</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref394_hfu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Literature search, sample articles M-V</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461284</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1977/1992" type="inclusive">1977-1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_1b92a2f3cee6b68043b542b32db59d7f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_e13d4ca186cc2f2567c433d1fdcf34e5" parent="aspace_1b92a2f3cee6b68043b542b32db59d7f" type="folder">5</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref280_ncx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Book proposal</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461285</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_e527735a6efdd9818d1ca262ecbeb247" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_9e5a4855cce37a8799ab89ecf05e1639" parent="aspace_e527735a6efdd9818d1ca262ecbeb247" type="folder">6</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref281_qeb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sample contracts</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461286</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992-1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_eff3b4d9577354f8f77202f67a8162e3" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_e8e6f795672e25921d835e2ac72b4059" parent="aspace_eff3b4d9577354f8f77202f67a8162e3" type="folder">7</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref282_n2x" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miscellaneous</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461287</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1992" type="inclusive">1990-1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_45e63222ec15f21f4614620be72110aa" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_2a0434905cf6398f4490453b40a93e52" parent="aspace_45e63222ec15f21f4614620be72110aa" type="folder">8</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref104_vku" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitid>2.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461288</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1995" type="inclusive">1992-1995</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b4b45698bbdd494b567ad2aaae7e6dcc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries contains letters from Mark Collins and Margaret Mary Kimmel, the editors of the book, to staff at the University Press concerning the development of the book, and to potential contributors inviting them to write an article for the book.

Much of the correspondence focuses on the fluctuating list of contributors, and discussion of how to replace or revise certain pieces.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_ref283_j2n" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mark Collins and Margaret Kimmel (editors)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461290</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_5af36421064190c70f1f2dd96a67e04c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_31db109072383dc70ed8b8366a188244" parent="aspace_5af36421064190c70f1f2dd96a67e04c" type="folder">9</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref284_rzr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Marge Petruska (funder)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461291</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1993" type="inclusive">1992-1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_198c360c596421e2fb4727a328a6e535" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_b927b910adb424558423072fe347fc43" parent="aspace_198c360c596421e2fb4727a328a6e535" type="folder">10</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref285_a78" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fred Hetzel (University of Pittsburgh Press)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461292</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1992/1994" type="inclusive">1992-1994</unitdate><container id="aspace_ae1662930e5b432cb38256988717098f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_5a57ba68dfdcb0a3c393f6cc301d6275" parent="aspace_ae1662930e5b432cb38256988717098f" type="folder">11</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref286_fhd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Catherine Marshall (University of Pittsburgh Press)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461293</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1994/1995" type="inclusive">1994-1995</unitdate><container id="aspace_b94a4f3a6b81e354cf666211d661a986" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_ff701b7a9b4de1fe7fa93ca74b29648e" parent="aspace_b94a4f3a6b81e354cf666211d661a986" type="folder">12</container></did></c04></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref109_tie" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Contributor Solicitations</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/461294</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6036b6195ede42ea992268226a83331b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This section contains correspondence to and from the potential contributors to the book. Many folders simply contain the standard solicitation letter that the editors sent out. There is more correspondence documenting the communication between the editors and those who agreed to participate in the project, including editorial comments on article drafts. Some of the final contributors can be inferred from the entries in Subseries 3, though some potential contributors initially agreed to the project and later either withdrew or were cut from the book. Some folders, in addition to the correspondence, contain either newspaper articles for inspiration, or drafts of the contributors' original articles.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_ref288_z25"

Of the seventeen final contributors, there are only essay drafts for nine of them. The contributors who wrote articles for the book who do not have drafts in this subseries are: George Gerbner, Lynn Johnson (photo essay), Jeanne Marie Laskas, Susan Linn, Mark Shelton, Paula Lawrence Wehmiller, and Eugenia Zuckerman, who interviewed Yo-Yo Ma for the book. There are essay drafts from Steven Shelov as well, but his article does not appear in the final publication. There are multiple copies of the essay drafts, and some have handwritten notes on them. Not all of the essays are dated, but almost all were probably written in 1992 to 1993. The reader's reports are the thoughts and comments from two outside readers who were asked to give their critiques by the University Press.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref419_mxj"
