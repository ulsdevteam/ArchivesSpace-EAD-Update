    <head>History</head>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh's jazz  program was founded in 1969 and is among one of the oldest collegiate jazz  programs in the country. After the university's music department became only the nation's third college to establish a formal jazz curriculum, Dr. Nathan Davis, a professional saxophonist and music educator was brought in to lead the program's development and establish a jazz ensemble. Dr. Davis led and grew the jazz studies at Pitt for forty four years until his retirement in 2013 when world renowned jazz pianist and Pitt Alumna, Geri Allen, took over as director of the University of Pittsburgh's Jazz Studies Program.</p><p>The university's Jazz Ensemble was founded in the early days of Dr. Davis' tenure as director with less than a dozen musicians. Since that time, the group has grown in both number and stature. Within three years of its formation, the Pitt Jazz Ensemble had risen from performing locally to performing at the internationally known Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland. The jazz ensemble has also toured the Southern United States, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. They perform annually at a spring concert that has featured a number of notable jazz performers as featured artists.    </p><p>Over the years, Pitt Jazz has perhaps become best known for its long running annual jazz seminar and concert. The event, now a staple of the Pittsburgh music scene, sprang from an impromptu event over forty years ago when Pittsburgh native and legendary jazz drummer Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers were playing a date in Pittsburgh's Hill District.  Dr. Davis, who had formerly toured with Blakely, approached the musician and asked if he could give a workshop to some of his jazz students. Despite the short notice, it was an overwhelming success. The success of Art Blakely's lecture prompted Dr. Davis to design and propose an annual university event that would bring multiple artists to the university each year. The plans eventually culminated in the University of Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar. The annual three day seminars include workshops given by professional jazz artists, where they are able to impart invaluable knowledge of their craft and the music industry to students, music educators, and the public, and a concluding 'all-star' concert to wrap up the weekend. The Pitt Jazz Seminar and Concert has had the has hosted a number of jazz legends including, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Clark Terry, Sonny Rollins, Kenny Clarke and Grover Washington, Jr. . The success of the University of Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar inspired the creation of two additional jazz entities at university, International Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame and the <title render="italic">International Jazz Archives Journal</title>.   </p><p>In 1977, Pitt Jazz established the International Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame to honor artists who have made extraordinary contributions to the musical genre. When the hall of fame was founded it was the first of its kind on any college campus. The hall of fame's inaugural inductees were five indisputable jazz legends: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, Charlie Parker, and Billie Holiday. Two new members were added to the hall of fame's ranks each year based on the votes of an international committee of jazz experts. The yearly inductions were often celebrated in conjunction with the annual University of Pittsburgh Jazz Seminar. In 1984 the International Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame unveiled a permanent display in the William Pitt Union. The display, which is open to the public, contains unique memorabilia and artifacts of hall of fame inductees such as an original painting by Miles Davis, a saxophone and trumpet accessories donated by Sonny Rollins and Clark Terry respectively, and a letter from Kenny Clarke to Charlie Parker.</p><p>Arising from a desire to parlay the successful discourse surrounding jazz during the seminar into more sustainable conversations, Dr. Nathan Davis founded the <title render="italic">International Jazz Archives Journal</title> in 1992. The yearly journal, edited by Davis, covered jazz education and scholarship, and analysis of the work acclaimed jazz artists, workshop transcripts from a prior jazz seminar, poetry, and music reviews.</p>  </bioghist>
