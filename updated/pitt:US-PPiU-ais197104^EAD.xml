    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Donald Stone was an eminent U. S. statesman and international policy advisor, who gained notoriety for applying the scientific management principles of private enterprise to government institutions, and earned respect through a commitment to reasonable and accountable government. His career as a public servant spanned the Depression and WWII eras, shaping domestic and foreign policy under the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. Stone's service with the State Department included formatting procedures for the Public Works Administration and planning and implementing the Works Progress Administration. He helped draft the original charters of the United Nations and the United Nations Economic, Social, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and his efforts were instrumental in the success of the Marshall Plan in rebuilding Europe after the Second World War.</p><p>Donald Crawford Stone was born in Cleveland, Ohio on June 17, 1903. He received a B. A. from Colgate University in 1925, an M. S. from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University in 1926, and post-graduate degrees from the University of Cincinnati and Columbia. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL. D.) from George Williams College in 1953, and again from Colgate in 1960.</p><p>Stone began his career in public service conducting research studies for the City of Cincinnati, and acted as director of research for the International City Managers Association at the University of Chicago from 1930 - 1933. In 1933, Stone became a founding partner of the private consulting firm Public Administration Service (PAS), a long-standing corporation providing policy analysis and implementation strategies for municipal, state, and national governments, worldwide. In the mid-1930's, Stone guided the merger of formerly separate organizations to form the American Public Works Administration, and became its first executive director. In 1939, Stone resigned from the board of PAS (though remained an honorary trustee his whole life) to accept the position of Assistant Director in Charge of Administrative Management at the Bureau of the Budget in the U.S. State Department (1939-1948), in the Executive Office of the President. In that capacity, he concomitantly served as a member of the United Nations' Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (1945-1949), and as a delegate to the U. S. National Commission for UNESCO (1946-1950).</p><p>In April 1948, President Truman created the Economic Cooperation Administration to oversee the disbursement of U.S. funds under the Marshall Plan, and Donald Stone was nominated as the ECA's first Director of Administration, a post he continued to hold through that body's transformation into the Mutual Security Agency in 1951, and again into the Foreign Operations Administration in 1953.
Stone served as president of Springfield College in Massachusetts before building the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh in 1957, as Dean emeritus, a post he held until 1968. He served on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University's H. J. Heinz Graduate School of Public Policy and Administration from 1975 until his retirement in 1992. From 1990 onwards, Stone, the director of the Coalition to Improve Management of State and Local Government, moved with the executive committee of said body to Indianapolis as the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs.</p><p>Stone was a founding member of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA), the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), and the Society for International Development, as well as a voluntary board advisor to the International Association of Chiefs of Police; president of the ASPA, the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, and International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration; as well as vice president of the American Political Science Association and senior fellow of NAPA. He participated on scores of national and international government advisory panels throughout his career and authored dozens of books and pamphlets on public policy and administration.</p><p>Donald C. Stone died at the age of 92 on October 19, 1995, leaving his wife, Alice Kathryn (nee Biermann), and four children, Nancy, Alice, Elizabeth, and Donald Crawford Stone, Jr.</p>  </bioghist>

N. Charter, which was signed on June, 26, 1945 by the representatives of 50 countries. The United Nations officially came into existence on October 24, 1945, when China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States ratified the Charter. There are six principal organs of the United Nations: the General Assembly and its six Main Committees; the Secretariat; ECOSOC; the Security Council; the Trusteeship Council, which oversaw states whose governance is trusted to the United Nations (and disbanded in 1991, with the independence of Papua); and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Stone's work with the Advisory Committee, establishing the foundations and framework of an international bureaucracy, intersected with the agendas of the Preparatory Committee and the Fifth Committee; his position in the State Department in resolving the United States' position after WWII demanded that he be informed of the actions of the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Economic and Social Council; and his Committee's work developing budgets and personnel policies ranged across nearly all sectors of the United Nations organization. </p><p>Records of the Preparatory Committee and General Assembly include the establishing instruments and charters of the U.N., manuals of operation, lists of personnel, and summary records of initial meetings. Of the six U.N. Committees, records of the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural) and the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) are included. Third Committee records relate to the relocation of international refugees, and records of the Fifth Committee describe establishing policies regarding departmental budgets and personnel. </p><p>The Secretariat is responsible for generating or printing the reports and official documents of all organs of the U.N., and includes separate departments for the office of the Secretary-General, the General Assembly, the ICJ, and each of the Councils. The Department of Public Information (DPI) handles documents for the General Assembly, and most U.N. press releases. Records of the Secretariat include Secretary-General's reports, and an organizational analysis authored by Stone.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref16_7vm" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Preparatory Committee</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43632</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref17_i7s" level="file"><did><unittitle>Establishing Instruments and Committee Reports</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43633</unitid><container id="aspace_1b5ee2abbbaf3a10517631c2eaf836a3" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_c5904e6d79c12a327939e8f65b074b09" parent="aspace_1b5ee2abbbaf3a10517631c2eaf836a3" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref18_s39" level="file"><did><unittitle>Budget Estimates, Salaries and Compensation</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43634</unitid><container id="aspace_265116b24c1bbdcff0456829d8976116" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_0e2caeae6aaa8ab623348b4ef57349f8" parent="aspace_265116b24c1bbdcff0456829d8976116" type="folder">2</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref19_deq" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>General Assembly</unittitle><unitid>2.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43635</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref20_f2v" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.

System of Organizations, a group of specialized, satellite agencies operating under the umbrella of the United Nations. Most were created as an outgrowth of the U.N.'s mission, but others came into being as separate entities with shared purposes, and were later absorbed by the U.N. Of these organizations, Donald Stone was most involved with the U.N. Economic and Social Council (UNESCO), and the U.N. Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). </p><p>Stone was a key member of the U.S. delegation to UNESCO. The U.S. had evident national interests in helping to shape an organization with the power to influence international cultural attitudes in the post-WWII world; so much, in fact, that the State Department created the U.S. National Commission on UNESCO to cement U.S. policy relations with the organization. Stone served on the Executive Committee of the U. S. Commission; meetings were held annually at the regional level, and biannually at the national level. The UNESCO records are the most chronologically extensive in the collection, ranging from early 1946 to late 1949.</p><p>The UNRRA was founded in 1943 to provide support to refugees held by the Axis powers during WWII. Though established prior to the founding of the U.N. organization, the UNRRA received its name from President Roosevelt, who coined the term "United Nations" in 1942 to refer to the Allied powers. The UNRRA channeled billions of U.S. dollars of rehabilitation aid, and was integral to Stone's work implementing the Marshall Plan. It ceased operations in Europe in 1947, and in Asia in 1949, upon which it ceased to exist, and its functions were transferred to other U.N. agencies, primarily the International Refugee Organization (IRO). </p><p>All documents in the UNRRA files are marked as property of—and in the case of reports, were co-authored by—Ruth Crawford Mitchell, who served as an acting consultant on repatriation assistance with the UNRRA in Egypt from 1944-1946. Mitchell was an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh from 1924-1956, and was largely responsible for the inception and direction of the Nationality Rooms project in the Cathedral of Learning there. Stone would have had contact with Mitchell during his time as Dean of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at Pittsburgh, 1957-1968; Stone probably came into possession of these papers early in that time. For further information, researchers may wish to consult the Collection of Ruth Crawford Mitchell, 1926-1980, UA90/F-12, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh. </p><p>As part of his work with international aid programs, Stone advised the U.S. delegation to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1945-1946, and relevant records are included in this series.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref42_blp" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) &amp; Specialized Agencies</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43657</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref43_qgt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Summaries, Work Programmes, and Personnel Reports of Related Agencies</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43658</unitid><container id="aspace_844623a57c58be8cb7512d7a7235507e" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_f90a5e0778ed9974c4b68a09e216d91c" parent="aspace_844623a57c58be8cb7512d7a7235507e" type="folder">11</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref44_qzm" level="file"><did><unittitle>IRO and Economic Commission for Latin America Journals and Reports</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43659</unitid><container id="aspace_a19f1e162317140d093cdf7f71636a7f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_df7d5f038966bc67996a1bf1caf4f2f6" parent="aspace_a19f1e162317140d093cdf7f71636a7f" type="folder">12</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref45_2m0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memoranda, Notes, and Draft Reports of Donald Stone</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43660</unitid><container id="aspace_0ffac30f19a0914c2339162dd376fdee" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_5e4daaab18cd9dcbfaa1ca98e09a7506" parent="aspace_0ffac30f19a0914c2339162dd376fdee" type="folder">1</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref46_o0s" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (est. 1945)</unittitle><unitid>2.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43661</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref47_0xd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Preparatory Commission Minutes and Reports</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43662</unitid><container id="aspace_c847eaced6773a07bf3e08dcef1dca14" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_edb0ad4495eaef58bdcc552195b6994a" parent="aspace_c847eaced6773a07bf3e08dcef1dca14" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref48_33c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Establishing Instruments and Constitution</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43663</unitid><container id="aspace_cf46d9ef1b7636edcf107407f383a483" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_3e5d32f432b4c209409141cf77873c49" parent="aspace_cf46d9ef1b7636edcf107407f383a483" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref49_6kk" level="file"><did><unittitle>Personnel, Programmes and Reports</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43664</unitid><container id="aspace_284118fb25cb934d2036112de92ef30c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_7f7794079b68c0688fc560239a3e225c" parent="aspace_284118fb25cb934d2036112de92ef30c" type="folder">4</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref50_ktm" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.

The "ACABQ" is composed of international personnel of civic and financial executives, convened to advise the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly (Administrative and Budgetary). In this role, the Advisory Committee informed policy and budget architectures dealing with the creation of the entire U.N. bureaucracy, and the documents in this series address all of the agencies represented by other series in this collection. </p><p>Files are organized in close approximation of an outline titled "Organization of Files," authored by Donald C. Stone, and found within related Advisory Committee documents. Wherever possible, files have been arranged in the original order specified by this document. Some documents have been appropriated away from file series relating to their originating agencies; notably, Management Surveys attributed to the Bureau of Administrative Management and Budget, an office of the U.N. Secretariat; documents outlining to the election of judges to the ICJ; and newspaper clippings, correspondence, and preliminary legal agreements regarding the establishment of the U.N. Headquarters in Manhattan. The International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) was not formally established until 1974, but documents relating to its proposal by the U.S. delegation to the U.N. are included here. Correspondence ultimately handled by Donald Stone, dealing with ACABQ matters, may have originated in a variety of U.S. or U.N. government departments. </p><p>The ACABQ had its nascence in Committee Six, the Advisory Committee to the Preparatory Commission of the U.N., and relevant documents are placed in that file. </p><p>The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions belongs to a subsidiary class of General Assembly agencies, along with the Committee for Programme and Coordination, the Committee on Contributions, and the Investments Committee. Documents are filed under "Investments" and "Contributions."</p><p>Under the heading of "Summary Records of Meetings," is a folder containing information from the Third Session, held September 22, 1948. This distinction was not made by Stone, but was evident due to an exceptional amount of contiguous, germane material, including a meeting agenda addressing recurring issues that may be cross referenced throughout the series, including the budgets of specialized agencies, the adoption of Spanish as a U. N. working language, and Security Council reports regarding the issue of Palestinian indemnity for U. N. personnel killed in the Middle East.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref119_jhr" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Committee Reports and Correspondence</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid

Trieste was established in 1947 as a condition of the Treaty of Peace with Italy after WWII, and was formally dissolved and divided between Italy and Yugoslavia in 1954.

Harding. The Bureau of the Budget was moved to the Executive Office of the President in 1939 and was run by Harold D. Smith during the government's rapid expansion of spending during the Second World War. This series covers Dr Donald Stone's work in the executive branch, primarily after he was transfered to the Bureau of the Budget as the Assistant Director. </p><p>The first subseries of note is the Bureau of the Budget, containing papers pertaining to Stone's time as assistant director of the Bureau. The content of the documents range from management of the Bureau, staff memmors, the founding of the Bureau as a distinct entity within the federl government, and an administrative diary by Stone himself. </p><p>The next subseries of note is Stone's Administrative Observations, having been contained in a binder upon acquisition by the archives. In it, Stone records his tasks, schedule, and provides input on his opinions with regards to the prosecution of the war and the handling of the Bureau. </p><p>The final subseries of note is that of Executive Reorganization. These papers are wide in variety, some arising from Stone himself as the assistant director, others from those outside of government. They all share in common the discussion of reorganizing the federal government, in the form of reports, acts of Congress, memos, periodicals, and conference speeches.   </p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref129_zyi" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Bureau of the Budget</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43732</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref163_irt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Management</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43733</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Nov 24, 1943 -

The purpose of the Coalition was to provide state and local governments with reports, management guides, and access to professionals who could help move city, county, and state governments towards their policy objectives. This series in particular focuses almost exclusively with Allegheny County, wherein Dr. Stone personally oversaw development. There are four subseries of note</p><p>The Allegheny County CODE Project, as organized before arrival at the archive, deals with reports, guides, and special papers concerned with the management of Allegheny County government. After Pennsylvania passed Act 62 in 1972, granting cities the right to Home Rule, Allegheny county embarked on a spirited campaign to reform the executive and legislative functions of the county government, as well as improve efficiency in general. Contained wihin this subseries is an additional subseries pertaining to documents which Dr. Stone used as a reference form outside Pennsylvania, such as Wisconsin and Delaware's constitutions and county statutes.  </p><p>The Mayor Peter Flaherty subseries covers Dr. Stone's involvement in the nascent Flaherty administration following his election in 1970, through to 1977 when Mayor Flaherty was nominated as the Deputy Attorney General in the Carter Administration. Contained herein are papers, memos, and correspondences between Dr. Stone and Peter Flaherty where Dr. Stone offers to send GSPIA students as volunteers for the Flaherty administration, and his personal misgivings about Flaherty as a Deputy Attorney General. </p><p>Handbooks covers published books and manuals from the Coalition, designed to help government officials navigate their new posts. This subseries also contains the Strategic Goals of the CODE Project, wherein the particular annual goals for Allegheny County are recorded and quotas made. </p><p>Finally, the Allegheny County Office of Management and Budget covers reports, memos, and updates on various programs. The OMP as established between 1987 and 1988 as a new division of the Department of Administration, with the purpose of improving productivity and spearhead projects and studies with county-wide scope.

Two that are especially of note are the American Society of Public Administration and the Public Administration Service, both of which Dr. Stone was a founding member of. </p><p>The Public Administration Service (PAS) was chartered in 1933 in the State of Illinois to provide professional management consulting services, applied research, technical assistance, and training to government and quasi-government departments and agencies, with a primary focus on local government. PAS would publish the book <title render="italic">The President and the Presidency</title> in 1949, which was one of the first attempts to define executive government.  PAS continued this research focus throughout its first twenty years, creating a respectable list of published books under its imprint, while being funded exclusively through grants. After the Second World War, and particularly by the early 1950s, PAS began to work intensively overseas. </p><p>The American Society for Public Administration was founded in 1939 by Louis Brownlow, William E. Mosher, Donald C. Stone, Charles A. Beard, Harold D. Smith, Luther Gulick, and others. The ASPA sponsorsed the Public Administration Review since 1939, established the the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) as part of ASPA in 1967, only to formally separate in 1970, and, in 1981, established with NAPA of National Public Service Awards, of which Stone would be an early recipient.</p><p>Wihin the Subseries covering the ASPA are membership reports, addresses to conferences hosted by the ASPA, newsletters, and other internal organizational documents. </p><p>Within the subseries concerning the PAS, documents have retained the order in which they were recieved, with the exception of documents pertaining to the Press Bureau Round Table and Police Effectiveness. Otherise, all documents herein come from a binder labeled "Public Administration Service" as organized by Stone himself. </p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref138_0xk" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Social Science Research Council</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43852</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref268_a2q" level="file"><did><unittitle>Committee on Public Administration Conferences</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43853</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Jul 22 and Nov 5, 1942 -

He would remain the dean of GSPIA until he retired from the position in 1968 while still teaching at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1975, he moved to Carnegie Mellon Univeristy's Heinz College of Information systems and Public Policy, and set up the Coalition to Improve Management of State and Local Government. In 1990, he moved with the executive committee of the Coalition to Indiana and worked with the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs until his retirement from academia in 1992. </p><p>Docments contained herein consist of lecture notes and outlines for class discussions from Stone's time at American University; several papers concerned with what can be dubbed "Management Theory", as the papers arise either from Stone's time in academia but without a date, or are from outside sources which Dr. Stone felt were worth preserving; and lecture notes from his time at GSPIA, Heinz School, and Indiana's SPEA. Similarly, there are five papers from five different authors concerned with the Institutional Presidency and the Executive Office, from the National Academy ogf Public Administration, written for a conference in april 1980. </p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref135_rsa" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Management Theory</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43874</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref286_0gu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Works by Dr. Stone</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43875</unitid><container id="aspace_872e0eab5fa9bef4acfe11e96c643907" label="Text" type="box">17</container><container id="aspace_e30113c24cf5702779c19b405a71f2bb" parent="aspace_872e0eab5fa9bef4acfe11e96c643907" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref287_0mh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ethics</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43876</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Jul 1973 - Feb 26, 1981</unitdate><container id="aspace_4e6fbe2c3d0328c08589c4e19700bc96" label="Text" type="box">17</container><container id="aspace_e54734deada64b75ca3609d76c0294b0" parent="aspace_4e6fbe2c3d0328c08589c4e19700bc96" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref288_3md" level="file"><did><unittitle>Outside Literature</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43877</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Sep 20, 1939 - Jun 14, 1946</unitdate><container id="aspace_00dcb356caa956f7d1b327d496738ed4" label="Text" type="box">17</container><container id="aspace_4b2ef3c24c4319254ee4718f2146c6ad" parent="aspace_00dcb356caa956f7d1b327d496738ed4" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref289_l5p" level="file"><did><unittitle>Notes on the Governmental Executive</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43878</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Jan 15, 1945</unitdate><container id="aspace_30dcac92c2bc21af67fb0c36025c2592" label="Text" type="box">17</container><container id="aspace_0e74fedd17d63c5779744c9cfe724bfc" parent="aspace_30dcac92c2bc21af67fb0c36025c2592" type="folder">4</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref133_axb" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>GSPIA, CMU Heinz School, Indiana University SEPA</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43879</unitid></did><c03 id="aspace_ref292_8nu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Indiana University, School of Public and Evironmental Affairs/Coalition</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43880</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Jan 25, 1993 - Mar 3, 1994</unitdate><container id="aspace_cca560c768cd83a769378327ab1611e8" label="Text" type="box">17</container><container id="aspace_a1f07f4a65ade8d11045c40108189e9b" parent="aspace_cca560c768cd83a769378327ab1611e8" type="folder">5</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref294_pv0" level="file"><did><unittitle>University of Pittsburgh, GSPIA</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43881</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Oct 16, 1961 - Jan 19, 1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_3c1b94a69b7de57aff290cd2ec17d2d0" label="Text" type="box">17</container><container id="aspace_10fecd0391833904366170ef5ede2620" parent="aspace_3c1b94a69b7de57aff290cd2ec17d2d0" type="folder">6</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref295_iis" level="file"><did><unittitle>Carnegie-Mellon University</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43882</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Spring 1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_2d1f0a16dec004c2928e1f749ca4da58" label="Text" type="box">17</container><container id="aspace_7372e86147deded2a7b4d2d51992f518" parent="aspace_2d1f0a16dec004c2928e1f749ca4da58" type="folder">7</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref293_ugp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Other Schools</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/43883</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">May 14, 1953;
