    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>John P. Robin, son of Peter and Bessie Robin, was born in Passavant Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on October 15, 1912.  Robin spent his infancy in the coal mining town of McDonald, Washington County, Pennsylvania, located approximately 20 miles southwest of downtown Pittsburgh.  When Robin was three years old his parents moved the family to Pittsburgh and opened a pharmacy at Melwood Street and Centre Avenue in Oakland.  </p><p>As a student, Robin attended Pittsburgh public schools, eventually graduating from Schenley high school before enrolling to the University of Pittsburgh where he majored in biology.  Because of the Great Depression, Robin left school during his senior year prior to graduating.  In 1934, Robin secured a job with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as a writer; however, his time at the Post-Gazette ended in 1936 when Robin entered into local politics.  
In November, 1936, Robin went to work as the secretary for Pittsburgh Mayor Cornelius D. Scully.  Robin held that position until 1941 when the Mayor Scully appointed him Director of Welfare Activities in the city's Department of Welfare.  Robin temporarily left his political career during World War II when he enlisted in the Army, serving from 1943-1945.  Upon release from the Army, Robin returned to his hometown of Pittsburgh where in 1946 he was offered the position of Executive Secretary to Mayor David L. Lawrence.  That same year the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) was formed and Robin selected as its first director.  Robin would remain Executive Secretary and close confidant to Mayor Lawrence, as well as, serving at the director of the URA.  As director, Robin oversaw the development of projects, such as Gateway Center and Point State Park, during Renaissance I.      
During a nine month stretch in 1955, Robin left Pittsburgh for Harrisburg to join Governor George M. Leader's cabinet as Secretary of Commerce.  Robin returned to Pittsburgh in 1957 as president of the Regional Industrial Development Corporation (RIDC).  Later that same year, Robin moved to Philadelphia where he served as the Executive Vice President of the Old Philadelphia Development Corporation.  While there, Robin oversaw the redevelopment of Society Hill and Independence Mall.  
In 1963, Robin went to work for the Ford Foundation which relocated him to Calcutta, India.  In Calcutta, Robin served as the chief consultant to the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Organization.  In 1967, Robin transferred to Nairobi, Kenya, where he spent three years directing Ford Foundation programs in nine East African Countries.  From Nairobi, Robin went on to Athens, Greece, where he worked on a worldwide study of the free world's developing urban centers.  
In 1973, Robin returned to Pittsburgh as a Professor at the University of Pittsburgh and an advisor to the Allegheny Conference on Community Development.  He served as the chairman of the URA board from 1977 to 1994 during Renaissance II while also serving as chairman of the Port Authority.  Robin also served as the chairman of the Port Authority Special Task Force, vice chairman of the Allegheny County Planning Commission, county representative of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission, the Mayor's Oakland Task Force, and the Mayor's Development Council.  John P. Robin died on May 07, 2000, at age 87.
