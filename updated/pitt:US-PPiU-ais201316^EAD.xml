    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>The Frances Hesselbein Papers document the life and work of one of the leaders in the world of nonprofit management. The collection contains a wide variety of materials, including information on the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management (1990-2002), the Leader to Leader Institute (2003-2011), and the Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute (2012-2017), as well as Hesselbein's personal life. The records are divided into two subgroups, the records of the Hesselbein Institute and its predecessors; and the personal records of Frances Hesselbein. Materials are dated as early as the 1930s and 1940s, up until the present day. Most of the material comes from the time towards the end of Hesselbein's tenure with the Girl Scouts of the United  States of America in the 1980s and continues through her work with The Drucker Foundation/Leader to Leader/Hesselbein Institute.  </p><p>The records in these subgroups represent two distinct categories of information, as specified by the donor. In the first subgroup, that of the institution, there are materials relating to Hesselbein, but there are also materials more specifically concerned with the Institute itself, such as meeting minutes, conference plans, publications, staff correspondence, and audio/visual materials produced by or relating to the institution. There are also records of Peter Drucker himself, such as articles written over his lifetime and information related to the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California, where Drucker was a professor. </p><p>In the second subgroup, containing personal material, there are records related to Hesselbein's time with the Girl Scouts, information on other nonprofit organizations with which she spent time, copies of speeches given in the past 35 years, and audio/visual materials relating to these topics, as well as Hesselbein herself. There is also information on events attended by Hesselbein, and documents relating to her family life as well. The materials in this subgroup, unlike in the first, almost always deal specifically with Frances Hesselbein. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Frances Richards Hesselbein (1915-2022) was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1915, the oldest of three children. Her education includes classes at the University of Pittsburgh's Johnstown Campus, though after her father died she left school and supported her family. She married John D. Hesselbein, an alumnus of the University of Pittsburgh, who worked for the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat and later opened his own documentary-filmmaking and photography studio. While assisting her husband at the studio and raising their son, John, Hesselbein was approached by a local group of women with the request to take over the leadership of a local Girl Scout troop. Despite not having a girl in the troop herself, Hesselbein agreed and took charge since the troop would be disbanded without a leader. She stayed with that group of girls until they graduated high school.  Later, she was asked to take on the role of Talus Rock Council Executive Director in Johnstown, which she accepted. Following a successful period in this position, she was invited to apply for the position of National Executive Director (CEO) of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. She served in that role from 1976-1990 as the first woman to be appointed to that position from within the organization. </p><p>During her time with the Girl Scouts, Hesselbein helped to transform the organization. She had the uniform redesigned as well as the logo, worked to increase minority representation, and also helped create the Daisy program for 6-year-old girls. Membership in the Girl Scouts increased greatly under Hesselbein's leadership as well, reaching up to 2.25 million girls in all. Hesselbein also implemented her leadership strategy of "Banning the Hierarchy", incorporating the idea of "Circular Management." This strategy, among others, would follow Hesselbein when she retired from the Girl Scouts.</p><p>After leaving the Girl Scouts in 1990, Hesselbein was invited to work on a new project. Her friend Peter Drucker, often called "The Father of Modern Management" for his business expertise, was to be honored by a new nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting leadership and management skills and tools, which would eventually be called the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management. Hesselbein led the organization through the 1990s in different roles. In 2003, the organization was renamed the Leader to Leader Institute though the mission of the institute remained the same. In 2012, it would become the Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute, which Hesselbein led as President and CEO. In 2017, Hesselbein partnered with the University of Pittsburgh, who acquired the organization, which was renamed The Frances Hesselbein Leadership Forum. The Hesselbein Forum resides in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs (GSPIA), Johnson Institute for Responsible Leadership. </p><p>Hesselbein served as the Chair of the Hesselbein Forum, as well as the editor-in-chief of the Leader to Leader Journal. </p><p>Hesselbein was very active in various nonprofit organizations in addition to her work at the Hesselbein Forum. She worked with retired members of the military to promote the Generals in Transition and the Investment in America programs. She has served on the boards of nonprofits and corporations, including the Bright China Social Fund and Mutual of America Life Insurance Company. In 2009, working with her alma mater, Hesselbein helped establish the Frances Hesselbein Global Academy for Student Leadership and Civic Engagement at the University of Pittsburgh, inviting students around the world to participate in sessions focused on creating the leaders of tomorrow.</p><p>Frances Hesselbein received a number of awards, including 22 honorary degrees. In 1998 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton, as "a pioneer for women, diversity, and opportunity." She also served as the West Point Class of 1951 Chair for the Study of Leadership, a two-year appointment. Hesselbein was the first woman and the first non-graduate to hold this position. Hesselbein was also named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Frances Hesselbein died on December 11, 2022 at her home in Easton, Pennsylvania at the age of 107 years.</p>  </bioghist>

The books include those published by the Drucker Foundation and Leader to Leader Institute and are featured in a variety of languages. They are organized chronologically by publication date, though if numerous versions of the same copy existed, these copies were placed together. The series also contains information from various management seminars. Some are products of the Drucker Foundation, while others are from outside nonprofit organizations with which the Drucker Foundation worked. The outside publications provide a sample of the various organizations with which the Drucker Foundation and its later iterations interacted. Many of the documents deal with the Drucker Foundation's Self-Assessment Tool. This series also contains information on the publication of some of these items, specifically those dealing with the Drucker Foundation and later the Leader to Leader Institute.</p></scopecontent><c03

Fellows applied with a specific goal in mind for their organization and the ways in which they thought to accomplish these tasks, and after being selected were given a mentor from the management community. Those chosen were also provided various opportunities to meet and discuss topics with other leaders during their year-long appointment.

Materials in this series include video cassette tapes, audio cassette tapes, CD-ROMs, DVDs, and various forms of photographic images. Most of the videos were produced by the Drucker Foundation and Leader to Leader Institute, and a large number of the video and audio cassette tapes feature recordings from the conferences held by these institutions throughout the years. There are also videos of Peter Drucker speeches, and seminars run by Frances Hesselbein. The Drucker Foundation subseries contains four unidentified boxes of open reel audio tape. The A/V materials have been arranged within each subseries starting with the oldest formats, such as Betacam or VHS tapes, and ending with the last, usually DVDs. Multiple formats of some productions were kept to ensure preservation of the content.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref1869_mh6" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>The Peter F.

The records contained in this group are of both a personal and professional nature, though they relate to Hesselbein's life outside of The Drucker Foundation and its later versions. This subgroup therefore includes information pertaining to Hesselbein's relationship with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America, both during her time in that organization and after. There is information on publications from Hesselbein herself, such as specific materials related to the creation of her autobiography. Press and event materials contained in the subgroup relate to both Hesselbein and her colleagues or organizations with which she was associated. Hesselbein's speeches dating back to the mid-1970s are also included here. The media for this subgroup includes materials from the Girl Scouts, but focuses mainly on Hesselbein herself, with some material from her family as well. The media materials are mainly dated from the 1980s to the present day, though there are some items that originate from the earlier times.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref9_rmr" level="series"><did><unittitle>Girl Scouts of the United States of America</unittitle><unitid>I.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/358080</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1968/2013" type="inclusive">1968-2013</unitdate><langmaterial><language langcode="eng">English</language>.</langmaterial></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9ddfc93a4ecf451ada70a22fdb8d30dd"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>This series contains documents from Frances Hesselbein's time as CEO of the Girl Scouts, as well as later years.

There are a variety of materials dealing with the 100th anniversary celebration that occurred in 2012, including conference information, correspondence, and a book from the Girl Scouts on the topic. The documents range from 1968-2012, and media for the Girl Scouts may be found in Series IX of this subgroup.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref10_kuf"

dated from 1960-2013. The books include those written by Frances Hesselbein, or those featuring her in some form. They are organized chronologically by publication date. Many of the records in this series deal with Hesselbein's process for writing, including materials sent to colleagues for editing, and correspondence on the matters of Hesselbein's books. These materials also include the drafts of excerpts from Hesselbein's books. There are also publications from organizations with which Hesselbein was affiliated or in whose activities she was interested, such as a newsletter from the Daughters of the American Revolution. The inclusion of these items provides a view of other organizations Hesselbein considers important or worthwhile.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref610_hjw"

speeches made about her, and her collection of speech reference files. The speeches are generally transcripts of presentations, though there are some reading copies. They are arranged chronologically, with the undated materials present at the end of each subseries. Speeches that were originally grouped with extraneous materials, such as an invitation to the event at which the speech was given, were separated out of the rest and given individual files. These speeches appear after the rest of the chronologically ordered materials. The speech reference files were kept in their original order and retain the names given to them by Hesselbein and her associates.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref1130_fpc" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Hesselbein speeches</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/358591</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1987" type="inclusive">1976-1987</unitdate></did><c04 id="aspace_ref1168_icm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Speeches</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/358592</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1987" type="inclusive">1976-1987</unitdate></did><c05 id="aspace_ref1131_yn1" level="item"><did><unittitle>"What It Means to Belong"</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/358593</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container id="aspace_4ffe2db953bc1b9871921d130988f7ef" label="Mixed Materials [31735070912393]" type="box">26</container><container id="aspace_35db63061b6f8b5786583195b6e19c39" parent="aspace_4ffe2db953bc1b9871921d130988f7ef" type="folder">1</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="31735073087672" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="&quot;What It Means to Belong&quot;" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>"What It Means to Belong"</p></daodesc></dao></did></c05><c05 id="aspace_ref1132_647" level="item"><did><unittitle>Salem Methodist Church</unittitle><unitid>2.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/358594</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">March 15, 1981</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="31735073087797" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Salem Methodist Church" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Salem Methodist Church</p></daodesc></dao></did></c05><c05 id="aspace_ref1134_84b" level="item"><did><unittitle>Deloitte Haskins and Sells -
