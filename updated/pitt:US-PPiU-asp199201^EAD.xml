    <abstract id="aspace_beb8c53a09c21effefca24ad35c29b26" label="Abstract">Bruno de Finetti was an Italian probabilist and statistician, noted for the "operational subjective" conception of probability. He provided significant contributions to the theory and the foundations of probability, and his work laid the foundation for the modern subjectivist interpretation of probability. The papers include de Finetti's student notebooks, research papers, lecture and teaching notes, professional and administrative records, newspaper clippings, personal and professional correspondence, and volumes of books from his personal library.

    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Bruno de Finetti was born on June 13, 1906, in Innsbruck, Austria, and died in Rome on July 20, 1985. He began his academic career at the Polytechnic of Milan in 1923 as a student of engineering but later enrolled in the mathematics program at Milan University. While still an undergraduate student, he published his first paper in the area of biomathematics titled "Mathematical Considerations Regarding Mendelian Heredity."</p><p>After completing his degree in applied mathematics in 1927, he joined the newly formed Italian census bureau, Istituto centrale di statistica (ISTAT), in Rome. In 1930 he obtained a position as an assistant professor in mathematical analysis at the University of Trieste. One year later he also started working at the insurance company "Assicurazioni Generali" in Trieste on the company's system automation with IBM machines while at the same time teaching calculus of probability at the University of Trieste. In 1936 he entered the competition for the chair of financial mathematics and statistics. Although finishing first place, he was not nominated due to a fascist law denying access to this position to unmarried candidates. Eventually, in 1950, he was appointed ordinary professor at the University of Trieste, effective retroactively to the year 1942. In 1954 he accepted a call to the faculty of economy and commerce at the University of Rome and transferred in 1961 to the chair of calculus of probability at the faculty of mathematical, physical, and natural sciences. De Finetti stayed at the University of Rome until his retirement in 1976. He died in Rome on July 20, 1985.</p><p>De Finetti provided significant contributions to the theory and foundation of probability, both from methodological and philosophical points of view. His concept of subjective probability evolved as a result of his profound interest in the application of logical theories, such as the application of mathematics to actuarial questions, to the statistics of insurance, and to the organizational techniques of public administration.</p><p>De Finetti also pioneered the concept of "exchangeability" or "exchangeable events." With the introduction of this model, he discovered a way of connecting the notion of subjective probability with the traditional procedures of statistical inference. De Finetti developed his ideas on subjective probability in the 1920s independently of Frank P. Ramsey. He only became known in the Anglo-American statistical world in the 1950s when L. J. Savage introduced his writings.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Notes</head>
<p>The papers include de Finetti's student notebooks, research material, lecture and teaching notes, professional and administrative records, newspaper clippings, personal and professional correspondence, and books from his working library. The majority of the documents are in Italian and some are in English, French, and German.</p><p>The papers, mainly covering the years 1930-1985, are organized into several series and subseries according to subject matter. Original folders, created by de Finetti, are indicated by headings in quotation marks. Sometimes an inventory sheet by Fulvia de Finetti can be found at the beginning of these folders.</p><p>De Finetti's educational records (Series I) consist of notebooks and loose notes from his student days at the University of Milan during the years 1924-1927.</p><p>Documents comprised under "Professional Activities" (Series II) concern his involvement in numerous professional organizations, in academic business, and in publication projects. Topics include de Finetti's job applications at various institutions, academic business at the University of Trieste and Rome, and his membership on the scientific board of Statistica and in Accademia dei Lincei.</p><p>Bruno de Finetti's research papers (Series III) consist largely of notes, drafts, and typescripts, representing his scientific and academic work as well as its application in such projects as the development of a unified coding system for government records. Also documented is his participation in various national and international conferences and workshops. Major research topics featured in this series are probability theory, probability calculus, statistics, actuarial science, game theory, subjective probability, Bayes' theorem, and mathematics applied to economics.</p><p>The correspondence (Series IV) illustrates primarily de Finetti's research and academic activities. Noteworthy correspondents are, among others, Oskar Morgenstern, George Polya, Antonio Gennaro, Luciano Daboni, Dennis Lindley, Jerzy Neyman, Siro Lombardini, Pierpaolo Luzzatto-Fegiz, and Jimmie Savage. General events discussed are research by de Finetti and others, mutual exchange of papers and related comments, and de Finetti's publication and teaching projects. The material is arranged alphabetically according to correspondent and then chronologically within folders. However, please note that many pieces of correspondence can also be found in de Finetti's original, subject-related folders throughout the collection, which were not removed in order to preserve the original arrangement.</p><p>Series V documents de Finetti's personal interests such as his involvment in school reform and teaching methodology, his political activism, and related legal problems. A wide variety of materials illustrate de Finetti's efforts to improve science and mathematics teaching, teacher education, and school curricula. Subjects discussed are writings by de Finetti such as Il "saper vedere" in matematica and "Perchè la matematica?" de Finetti's plans for educational movies, and a project for an educational center for teachers. Numerous letters, memoranda, newspaper clippings, articles, and court documents give evidence of de Finetti's political and social activism. Documented are his memberships in the fascist party, his participation in the Movimento Politico Lavoratori (MPL), and his role as editor of the Radical Party's publication Notizie Radicali.</p><p>A collection of writings by de Finetti and others, mostly in form of offprints and typescripts, sometimes accompanied by related correspondence, is compiled under the last series (Series VI). These writings illustrate his lifelong political and social engagement on subjects ranging from domestic and foreign politics to ethics, politics of language, sustainable development, and Italian bureaucracy, just to name a few. In addition, annotated books from his library document his research work and his comments on the literature.</p>  </scopecontent>

id="aspace_f149eab1763d2d7e667a3a4cc75e2e06"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Series V covers two areas in which de Finetti showed great personal interest and involvement, and which extend beyond his professional activities. One of them is his interest in the theory of teaching, its application, and its improvement. The second area documents de Finetti's political and social activism and ensuing legal issues. Both areas are divided into two subseries. The first subseries is entitled Theory of Teaching and School Reform and contains typescripts, newspaper clippings, journal issues, and correspondence that illustrate de Finetti's efforts to improve science and mathematics teaching, teacher education, and school curricula. Subjects discussed are de Finetti such as <title>Il "saper vedere" in matematica</title> and <title>Perchè la matematica?</title>, de Finetti's plans for educational movies, and a project for an educational center for teachers. The second subseries is comprised under Socio-Political and Juridical Issues and holds letters, memoranda, newspaper clippings, articles, and court records. Documented are his membership in the facist party, his participation in the Movimento Politico Lavoratori (MPL), and his role as editor of the Radical Party's publication <title>Notizie Radicali</title>.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref180_7mt" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Theory of Teaching and School Reform</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/105244</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1957/1981" type="inclusive">1957-1981</unitdate></did><c03 id="aspace_ref181_31x" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Mat.
