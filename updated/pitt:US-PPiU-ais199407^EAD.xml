    <head>History</head>
<p>The Eberhardt and Ober Brewing Company was established in Allegheny City, Pa. (now Pittsburgh's North Side), in 1883 by two men of German brewing families. William Eberhardt was born in Alsace France, April 20, 1844, and emigrated with his parents to Allegheny City in 1846. Conrad Eberhardt, William's father, was a brewer in Wurtemberg, Germany and established a brewery, in his own name, in Allegheny City in 1848. He is said to be the first person to use steam power in Pittsburgh. William became head of the Brewery when his father retired in 1870 and enlisted his brother-in-law, John P. Ober to join the company.</p><p>John P. Ober was was born August 21, 1848 in Allegheny City and starting working at his father's brewery at age fifteen where he was employed for seven years until he joined with Eberhardt. Together they ran the William Eberhardt Brewery until 1883 when they absorbed the J.N. Straub Company Brewery and incorporated as the Eberhardt and Ober Brewing Company.</p><p>In 1889 the Eberhardt and Ober Brewing Company allied its interests with those of the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, with which it was consolidated into in 1899. Eberhardt died a couple of weeks later, March 25, 1899. Ober became treasurer of the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and held many other offices in Pittsburgh until his death on November 11, 1909.</p><p>Pittsburgh Brewing Company continued to brew Eberhardt and Ober's "Dutch" and "Club" brands until 1952 when they were discontinued. The Eberhardt and Ober Brewery buildings on Pittsburgh's North Side are listed on the National Register of Historic Sites and have been occupied by the Pennsylvania Brewing Company since 1986.</p>  </bioghist>
