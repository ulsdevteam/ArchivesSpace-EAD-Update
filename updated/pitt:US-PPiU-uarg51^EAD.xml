    <head>History</head>
<p>The appearance of the comet known as "Donati's Comet", discovered in Florence by Giovanni Donati on June 2, 1858, gave the initial stimulus to the founding of the observatory. Interest in the comets appearance caused a group of men (professional and business) to form the Allegheny Telescope Association. This group, among whom the most prominent were Professor Louis Bradley, Josiah King and Harvey Childs, met in Bradley's home on February 15, 1858, and resolved not only to found the A.T.A. but also to purchase a telescope.</p><p>On January 31, 1860, the A.T.A. ordered a 13-inch telescope from Henry Fitz of New York, and it was installed in 1861. On May 15, 1860, the A.T.A. officially adopted a constitution and by-laws, elected a board of directors, and appointed an Observatory Committee. This committee raised funds by subscription for the telescope and housed it in a new building which they called the "Allegheny Observatory" as it was centered on a hill on Perrysville Avenue in the old city of Allegheny.</p><p>Professor Bradley was custodian of the new telescope from 1861-1863. In 1865, Professor Philotus Dean, principal of Central High School in Pittsburgh, became first custodian of the Observatory. Both men served without pay, accepting the responsibility of the Observatory to promote the advance of science. Later in 1865, the A.T.A. deeded the telescope, the building and the land to the Western University of Pennsylvania (now University of Pittsburgh). In 1867, the official transfer was completed and Samuel Langley was appointed Director. Among many other accomplishments, Langley invented a device to measure the temperatures on the Sun's surface, known as a bolometer; "Standardized" time for railroad companies; and coined the terms "astrophysics" and "aerodynamics"</p><p>When Langley left to become Secretary of the Smithsonian in 1887, James Keeler became the acting director and used the 13" Fitz-Clark telescope to discover Saturn's rings were made of small particles instead of being one large disk. In the early 1890s, because of the increasing air pollution in Pittsburgh and the need for larger research facilities, a new building at a new site was designed. The new Allegheny observatory was built between 1900 and 1914 in Riverview Park. The old observatory was sold and at one point a hospital for an orphanage. The building was torn down in 1955.</p><p>The Fitz-Clark 13" is still used today. In 1974 a bequest in the memory of George Theiss was made to the Observatory allowing for renovations on the Thaw and Keeler Telescopes. The George W. Theiss Astronomical Laboratory was also established and houses machines used to measure stellar images obtained from telescopes. The Thaw lens was replaced in 1985.</p>  </bioghist>

After graduating from the Boston Latin School, he studied civil engineering and architecture. His first employment was as an assistant in the Observatory at Harvard University; soon afterwards he became an instructor at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. In 1867 Langley became the Director of the Allegheny Observatory which had been transferred from private hands to the Western University of Pennsylvania; at the same time he was elected to the chair of Astronomy and Physics at the University.</p><p>Langley's main field of interest was the sun. He made detailed drawings of sunspots, invented the bolometer (an instrument to measure the amount of heat in different parts of the sun's spectrum), and obtained accurate time by using the telescope and positions of the stars. He also made accurate time available to Pittsburgh, City Hall, and to local railroads--even the U.S. Naval Observatory used his system (Allegheny System) to supply the correct time to the nation. During his term Mr. William Thaw contributed much money to the Observatory as did Andrew Carnegie who stated: "This was my first considerable gift to an institution of learning." Langley left to become first assistant secretary and then secretary to the Smithsonian Institute. He remained in that position until his death in 1906. Samuel Pierpont Langley died in Aiken, South Carolina, on February 26, 1906.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref14_dav" level="file"><did><unittitle>A</unittitle><unitid

Tem from 1898-1900. Brashear was originally a mill worker, but, encouraged by his friend S.P. Langley and financially supported by William Thaw, he became a renowned lens-maker, setting up the Brashear Company which constructed both the 30-inch Thaw Memorial Telescope and the James E. Keeler Memorial Telescope. In 1867 Brashear raised matching funds from Thaw and Carnegie and he and Keeler drew up plans for a new observatory and equipment. In 1898, Keeler declared "The Observatory's usefulness is at an end" due to antiquated equipment, the encroachment of homes, factories, and the smoky, hazy atmosphere which obscured vision. Brashear spoke eloquently for aid in constructing a new "Temple of the Skies," but both the Panic of 1893 and the War of 1898 hampered the raising of funds. Discouraged, Keeler left for Lick Observatory at the University of California.</p><p>When Keeler died in 1906, his ashes were placed in the crypt of the memorial telescope built for him. Brashear persevered in his efforts to build a new observatory, eventually raising the $300,000 needed and securing a plot of land in Riverview Park. Appropriately, when the new observatory was dedicated in 1912, he was master of ceremonies (as he had been at the laying of the cornerstone in 1900).

Wadsworth was Director from 1900-1905. It was during Wadsworth's directorship on October 20, 1900 that the cornerstone of the new building was laid. Modifying and adding to the plans he was mostly concerned with the supervision of the construction of the new buildings and instruments. He also exerted his influence, along with Brashear and the Observatory Committee, in raising the needed funds. The Observatory was completed in 1905, but the work of equipping it delayed dedication until 1912.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref160_zsv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ab-Ae</unittitle><unitid

Originally from Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, Schlesinger was also president of the American Astronomical Society. His main research interest was the improvement of parallax measurements, a method of determining the distances to stars. The results of his investigations are world-renowned and he was considered an authority in that area of research. On the afternoon of Wednesday, August 28, 1912, the new observatory (Mr. Billquist was the chief architect) was dedicated and presented to the University of Pittsburgh. In the fall of 1907 Mrs. Christopher Lyman Magee donated funds to the Observatory for the purpose of establishing a publication for the research conducted by the Observatory which had been scattered throughout a variety of scientific periodicals. The first volume of the Allegheny Observatory came out in 1912 under the editorship of Frank Schlesinger. In 1920 Schlesinger left to assume the directorship of Yale Observatory.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref323_2g0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ad</unittitle><unitid

Wagman became an astronomer at the Observatory in 1930 and became acting director in 1941 upon Dr. Jordan's death. In 1946 he announced one of the rarest finds of modern astronomy: a dark star in the constellation Ophiucus, which he named "Alpha Opiuchi C." As a result of this discovery, he was appointed Director in 1947. He investigated stellar and astrometric binaries and undertook a comprehensive program of modernization. He played a leading role in the disseminating of information on astronomy to the Pittsburgh public community. He served as lecturer at Buhl Planetarium and conducted forums at the YMCA. He was prominent as a member of the American Astronomical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He left the Allegheny Observatory in 1970.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref1586_x2g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ab-Ad</unittitle><unitid

His primary interest was the sun and he began his studies of the sun immediately after assuming the post of Director. Langley prepared drawings of sun spots and associated phenomena and astronomers, today, are still familiar with Langley's classic drawing of the great sunspot of 1873.</p><p>In 1869 Langley devised and made operational the electric system of transmitting telegraphic time to several of the Pennsylvania Railroad lines which were associated with the observatory. In the area of magnetic disturbances, Langley was the first to associate such disturbances on the earth with solar outbreaks of an extremely active character.</p><p>Concerning studies in the realm of solar physics, Professor Langley was impressed with the idea that much radiant energy from the sun could not be recognized with instruments then in use, and after much experimentation, he invented the bolometer. With this instrument he succeeded in measuring the amount of heat radiation on the earth from the sun (the solar constant).</p><p>Professor Langley studied many minor though important questions concerning radiant energy. His investigations of the moon's temperature added greatly to our knowledge of the moon. Langley used his spectrobolometer to measure the highest temperature of the moon which was found to be approximately zero degrees centigrade and the lowest temperature of the moon which was found to be equivalent to the temperature of space.</p><p>Langley also collected data on the part of the solar system beyond the infra-red zone. With the aid of Professors Keeler, Very, and Page measurements were made by Langley utilizing the spectrobolometer and the galvanometer which he invented before photographic methods were develop.</p><p>Langley, of course, has received much recognition for his contributions to aeronautics. However, his original intention was not to construct a flying-machine, but instead to "determine the laws governing flight." At the Allegheny Observatory, Langley built a whirling arm on which "he tested airfoils, fusiforms and other aerodynamic objects, measuring their angels and pressures as they moved through the air at varying speeds." Studies of actual birds and "mechanical birds" ("winged contrivance" made of tin, cork, and rubber) were conducted and findings published in a paper entitled "Experiments in Aerodynamics."</p><p>Professor Langley left his post at the Allegheny Observatory in 1887 (leaving F.W. Very, his assistant, in charge) to become Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; later, following the death of Professor Baird, he was elected Secretary of the Institution in 1891. Langley continued his research in aerodynamics and from a catapult, on May 6, 1896, launched an unmanned, steam-powered flying machine over the Potomac. It flew more than a half mile and was subsequently recovered. The first manned flight of his gasoline-powered "aerodome" failed in 1903 because of a launching device defect. Glenn Curtiss successfully piloted Langley's restored plane eight years after his death.</p><p>Note: Calendar entries covering the period 1884-1889 (Letterpress books no.'s I, II, and III) consist of abstracts of letters selected from four areas of research: 1) magnetic disturbances, 2) solar radiation, 3) mapping of infra-red spectrum, and 4) aerodynamics. There are also selected abstracts relating to both the electric time signal service and miscellaneous correspondence.</p><p>Please note that references to pagination indicate number of pages letters occupy in letterpress books and not necessarily number of pages of actual letters.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref1670_554" level="file"><did><unittitle>Samuel Langley</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/6547</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1862/1872" type="inclusive">1862-1872</unitdate><container id="aspace_9880f7e0bd2cdcf5dfb64e74fbb1183c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">30</container><container id="aspace_9154e730a059d11a3d66173e71784f9e" parent="aspace_9880f7e0bd2cdcf5dfb64e74fbb1183c" type="volume">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref1671_hi2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Samuel Langley</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/6548</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1884/1887" type="inclusive">1884-1887</unitdate><container id="aspace_c6579aef36c6a22f081ac4aa84dfbbe1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">30</container><container id="aspace_85caa8c8347a110513ba62d8e5ffba12" parent="aspace_c6579aef36c6a22f081ac4aa84dfbbe1" type="volume">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_37b8e86f9e97fc282450f315fa441240"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This calendar, comprised of Volumes 2-3, was prepared by David Lieberman, a student in the Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, as an independent study project during September - December, 1973.</p></scopecontent><c04 id="aspace_ref2583_9jd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Reed, J.R.
