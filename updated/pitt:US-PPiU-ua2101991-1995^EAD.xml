    <head>Biography</head>
<p>J. Dennis O'Connor served as the sixteenth chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh from 1991 until his resignation in 1995. During his term he struggled with budget issues and the ramifications of Chancellor Wesley Posvar's controversial retirement plan. He worked to increase diversity at the university, implementing several different affirmative action programs for undergraduate and graduate students. O'Connor also oversaw the construction of Sutherland Hall, an undergraduate dormitory on upper campus, as well as the development of a Master Space Plan for Pitt.</p><p>O'Connor came to Pitt from the University of North Carolina (UNC), where he served as vice chancellor of academic affairs and provost, making him the highest-ranking academic official at the school. Prior to his time at UNC, O'Connor also served in several positions at the University of Southern California, including dean of the division of life science and chair of the biology department. He also served as a visiting professor at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and University of Nijmegan in Holland. O'Connor earned his B.S. from Loyola University in Chicago, his hometown. He earned a master's degree from DePaul University, and received his Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1968. </p><p>After stepping back from the chancellorship, O'Connor intended to take on a faculty position in the department of biology at Pitt. In December 1995, however, O'Connor left Pitt for the Smithsonian Institute, serving as Provost of that institution. He was also briefly the acting director of the National Museum of Natural History. In 2002 he left the Smithsonian for the University of Maryland, College Park to serve as their head of research and dean of graduate studies. He resigned from that role in 2004.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is arranged with respect to the original order created by the Office of the Chancellor. This includes retaining the structure of their filing system, referred to as the Mail Log Files. Material was kept in the categories decided upon by staff at the time of its creation, with exceptions to those documents shown to be obviously misfiled. The categories for the mail log are as follows:</p><p>01. Office of the Chancellor </p><p>02. Secretary of the University </p><p>03. Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs </p><p>04. Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement </p><p>05. Department of Athletics </p><p>06. Clerk of the Senate </p><p>07. Affirmative Action </p><p>08. Office of the Provost </p><p>09. Senior Vice Chancellor for Health Sciences </p><p>10. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) </p><p>11. Senior Vice Chancellor for Business &amp; Finance and Treasurer </p><p>12. Associations and Organizations </p><p>13. Colleges and Universities</p><p>Each of these 13 categories has subcategories that follow, with individual number assignments of their own. These are included in the folder titles of the files in the collection. It should be noted that for the first year of Chancellor O'Connor's tenure, the Office of the Chancellor used the same numbering system as Chancellor Posvar's office did; this changes with FY1993 and remains the same for the rest of his time as chancellor. The files from that first year have been grouped with those of the same subject, but their title reflects this different mail log number.</p><p>The overall collection is divided into four series: </p><p>I. Mail Log Files </p><p>II. Subject Files </p><p>III. Chronological Files </p><p>IV. Speeches </p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The administrative files of J. Dennis O'Connor contain materials relating to all aspects of O'Connor's time as leader of the University of Pittsburgh, from 1991-1995. O'Connor began his time as "President" of the university, a holdover from the time of Wesley Posvar, but later asked the Board of Trustees to change the title back to "Chancellor." The records generally consist of correspondence, meeting minutes and supplementary materials, internal reports, university publications, chronological files, and speeches. It should be noted that many of the files in the O'Connor papers were facsimile printouts on heat transfer paper, which fades over time. As a result, all faxes have been photocopied and the originals removed from the collection.</p><p>The first series contains material sorted in the Office of the Chancellor's Mail Log File system, where every document has been previously categorized and sorted by the Chancellor's staff.  Material within each mail log designation is sorted by fiscal year, which for the university begins on July 1st and ends June 30th of the next year (i.e., Fiscal Year 1992 is July 1, 1991 - June 30, 1992). Since Chancellor O'Connor stepped down on August 1, 1995, there is some material from FY1996 in the collection despite his only having been in office for one month of the fiscal year.</p><p>Chancellor O'Connor's collection continues after the mail log files with his chronological files, consisting of outgoing correspondence which may duplicate material present in the first series; his speeches, given at both Pitt and non-Pitt events; and subject files for materials not included in the mail log.</p><p>Areas of specific interest in the records may include the continuing development of Pitt's relationship with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), increased development of affirmative action programs by the chancellor, and the creation of the university's Master Plan.</p>  </scopecontent>

It includes information on major grant awards sought and received by the university, particularly through the grant reports and acknowledgement letters from Chancellor O'Connor in 04.06.06. Major foundations that the university consistently interacted with, such as the Hillman Foundation, have their own individual files. These records also include material relating to alumni, such as correspondence with and regarding the Alumni Association and major events on the university's calendar, such as Honors Convocation and Commencement. It also covers the Office of Special Events and the various programming efforts established by that office. The bulk of the material for events listed after 4.9 consists of guest lists.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref209_tco" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement</unittitle><unitid>4.0.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/476747</unitid></did><c04 id="aspace_ref1983_gxs" level="file"><did><unittitle>600.00.

They are sorted individually by date, retaining the original order in which they were organized by the Chancellor's Office. Files here generally consist of a transcript of O'Connor's remarks for a given event, though sometimes there are only brief notes or talking points for him to cover. Some events also include supplementary material, such as event programs or brief, related correspondence, but this is not the case for every event. Some items in this series are not actual speeches, but rather messages written as a greeting or commentary from the chancellor for publication. An index of speeches is available at the beginning of the series, though some speeches found in the series are not necessarily present in this index.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref2316_g27"
