    <head>Biography</head>
<p>The Darlingtons of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania trace their roots in America to Abraham Darlington of Cheshire County, England, who joined his aunt and uncle in Chester County, Pennsylvania, at the turn of the eighteenth century. Abraham's great-grandson, Benjamin Darlington (1790-1856), left Chester County and settled in Pittsburgh with his wife, Agnes McCullough. The Darlingtons of Pittsburgh are related to the Schenley and O'Hara families through the marriage of Benjamin and Agnes's son, William McCullough Darlington (1815-1889), to Mary Carson O'Hara. </p><p>William M. Darlington was a successful lawyer and one of the foremost experts in the colonial history of western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley. Mary shared her husband's passion for history, and was very proud of her family's ancestry, which she traced back to Irish nobility through her grandfather, James O'Hara. Through her father, Mary inherited Guyasuta: James O'Hara's estate near present-day Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. </p><p>William and Mary raised three children at Guyasuta, O'Hara, Mary, and Edith. A fourth child, Hillborn, died in childhood. For more detailed biographies of each family member, see the scope and content note provided for each individual's papers. William was the primary collector of his family's extensive library of books and manuscripts. After William's death in 1889, his widow and children maintained and added to his collection. In 1918 and 1925, William's daughters Edith and Mary donated the family library and manuscript collection to the University of Pittsburgh. These materials include original letters by George Washington, Colonel Henry Bouquet, General Anthony Wayne, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, General Cornwallis, General James Wilkinson, Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson and Daniel Webster. William M. Darlington also obtained and preserved John James Audubon's complete set of <title xlink:type="simple"><emph render="italic"><extref xlink:href="http://digital.library.pitt.edu/a/audubon/">Birds of America</extref></emph> </title>. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>The Darlington Family Papers consist of three separate accessions. The first group of materials was donated to the University of Pittsburgh by Mary Carson Darlington and Edith Darlington Ammon in 1918. In 1925, Mary Carson Darlington bequeathed the remainder of the family library and a number of ephemeral items to the University. The third accession consisted of a collection of correspondence between Edith Darlington and Mittie Hemphill that was presented to the University of Pittsburgh in November of 1977 by Richard Johnson of the New England Historic Genealogical Society. The Darlington-Hemphill letters had been gifted to the New England Historic Genealogical Society earlier in 1977 by Mrs. Henry Mayo, a granddaughter of Mittie Hemphill. </p><p>This collection was located in the Darlington Memorial Library in the University's Cathedral of Learning until 2007 when it was moved to the ULS Archives Service Center for processing, storage, preservation and service. However, it remains in the custodianship of the ULS Special Collections Department.</p>  </custodhist>

In 1774, he was appointed a government Indian agent, and traveled to western Pennsylvania where he traded with Indians at Fort Pitt on behalf of an eastern company, and purchased extensive lands from the federal government. In 1788, James became the second president of the Bank of Pennsylvania, and two years later he wed Mary Carson (1760-1834) of Philadelphia, and brought her to Pittsburgh. George Washington appointed him Quartermaster General of the United States Army in 1792. During his military career, James served in western Pennsylvania to quell the Whiskey Rebellion and in General Anthony Wayne's expedition against the Western Confederation. Anne Hemphill Herbert notes that James is credited with "saving the army with his efficient business methods and remarkable understanding of the Indian character and their various dialects." </p><p>In 1793, James purchased land at the forks of the Ohio from the United States government, and four years later he and his partner, Major Isaac Craig, built the first glass works in America on the southern banks of the Monongahela River. James became Pittsburgh's first burgess and was a founder of the First Presbyterian Church. 
Materials in this series provide information on early frontier life in Pennsylvania through various personal and professional letters as well as official government reports. Also included are copies of James and Mary O'Hara's wills, which are critical in understanding the inheritance of significant property holdings that are now important to Pittsburgh's history, including Schenley Park and the Fort Pitt Block House. Accompanying these materials is H.M. Brackenridge's critique of James O'Hara's will. An obituary of James O'Hara and newspaper articles describe his role in the early development of Pittsburgh and his dealings with the Indian tribes. James O'Hara's papers have been divided into subseries that separate personal and business papers from materials describing his legacy and estate.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref16_mfz" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Personal and Business Papers</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/14911</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fb4dc0b582bdb8fe332b9a4d72a06a74"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Various personal letters written by General James O'Hara to his wife and contemporaries describe conditions at Fort Pitt and along the Miami River in the 1790s, including a comment that surrounding Indian tribes were "intent on annoying our Frontiers."

husband of Agnes McCullough and father of William M. Darlington. Benjamin Darlington owned a thriving store and hotel, and eventually his wealth, prestige and family connections presented him with the opportunity to assist in leading the Allegheny Valley Railroad Company. Benjamin Darlington was the fourth generation of Darlingtons in the United States. Benjamin Darlington began as a carpenter's apprentice. After working in a store on Market Street, he gained enough capital to buy a hardware store with his brother, Samuel Darlington, and later owned one of Pittsburgh's only hotels. In 1833, he was elected president of the Allegheny Engine and Hose Company, and by 1837 he was one of the first officers on the Board of Trustees for Pittsburgh's Gas Works. Benjamin Darlington served as commissioner for the Allegheny Valley Railroad Company and contributed a major donation for the building of the Pittsburgh Theater. </p><p>The series concerning Benjamin Darlington includes documents explaining his endeavors as a successful entrepreneur while Pittsburgh was growing into a major city. The receipt books contain handwritten records of various transactions made by Benjamin Darlington, explaining his relevance to the real estate business in Pittsburgh. Listed are property holdings and rent collections including one by Alexander Brackenridge, who was at the time president of the United States Bank in Pittsburgh. Accompanying this are other transactions made by Benjamin Darlington as the executor to the estate of Jane McCullough (1766-1821), his mother-in-law. In addition to the receipt books, there are various letters to and from Benjamin Darlington, including correspondence from his brother, Samuel Darlington.

Darlington (1815-1889), was born to Benjamin Darlington and Agnes McCullough in Pittsburgh. William was educated in private schools as a child and young adult, and then went on to study at Jefferson College, now known as Washington &amp; Jefferson College, in Pennsylvania. He began his law career under the tutelage of Richard Biddle. </p><p>William was a devout Presbyterian, a well-respected attorney, member of the Pennsylvania Bar Association for fifty years, and Vice President of the Pennsylvania Historical Society. During the last eight years of his life, he was also a trustee of his alma mater, Jefferson College, and the Western University of Pennsylvania, now the University of Pittsburgh. William amassed an extensive collection of books, manuscripts and maps related to western Pennsylvania's colonial and revolutionary history. This library was supplemented by his wife and three eldest children. </p><p>This series is organized into three topical subseries. Subseries 1 contains materials related to William's collecting activities, including documentation of book purchases, correspondence with booksellers and fellow collectors, historical research notes, receipts, and membership certificates to historical societies. Subseries 2 contains William's personal papers, including correspondence and diaries. Subseries 3 encompasses financial and estate papers.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref56_poh" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Collection Activities and Research</unittitle><unitid>1.</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/14947</unitid></did><scopecontent id="aspace_875d9a82a231d5f2b9532ddfb9558c32"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Materials in this subseries document William's collecting and lending activities, the library at Guyasuta, and his personal research and writing. William collected books and manuscripts from vendors such as the Hakluyt Society, as well as individual booksellers. Correspondence with Richard S. Edes, James Veech and Joseph Albree are examples of William's contacts in the field of rare books. Also, seventeen receipts document the purchase of books from the law offices of Baldwin &amp; Ford, J. Munsel, and Burns &amp; Son, among others. A bound volume of book orders, demonstrates William's meticulous documentation of the books he ordered between November 30, 1847 and January 14, 1867, including the Audubon volumes. William's correspondence with A. Eaton, John Newton, J.M. Read, J. R. Lambdin, and W.C. Reichel all highlight his role as a consultant for other researchers, to whom he sometimes lent or sold books. </p><p>The great strength of this subseries is the documentation of volumes in the library at Guyasuta. The <emph>Classification of Books</emph> consists of three successive versions of a list of books in the library at Guyasuta. Mary used these three volumes to alphabetically catalog the books in the Darlington family library according to topic, including history, travels, horticulture and natural history, and poetry, drama and tales; sections also list magazines, newspapers, and maps. In addition to these larger volumes, this subseries includes a partial catalog and a partial inventory of books at Guyasuta; these smaller lists most likely repeat titles already listed in the <emph>Classification of Books</emph>. Additionally, design diagrams for library bookcases shed light on the original physical arrangement of the Guyasuta library. </p><p>William was deeply interested in historical research, as was his professional mentor, Richard Biddle, and this subseries contains bound volumes of William's notes and writings about various topics. His <emph>Commonplace Book</emph> and <emph>Research Notes</emph> discuss a variety of topics, including: the Ohio Company; Forts Pitt, Duquesne, Shippen and Kittanning; Guyasuta; the Allegheny River and the city of Pittsburgh; Old Westmoreland and Indiana Counties; the Montour family; the Shawnee (Shananese) and Seneca Indians; George Croghan and Henry Alexander; and shipbuilding and theater. The <emph>Historical Biographical Notes</emph> include William's thoughts on such diverse topics as the Californian coal mountains, British nobility, the Darlington family crest, American Indian rituals, and the papers of British officer Henry Bouquet (1719-1765). This subseries contains transcriptions of the Bouquet Papers, which William commissioned from the British Museum. The transcribed letters document communication between Colonel Bouquet and other British officers during the French and Indian War from locations throughout Pennsylvania, his military campaign to drive the French out of Fort Duquesne, and the battle with Indians at Bushy Run. William was profoundly interested in the Ohio Company, and collected many papers relating to this eighteenth century land-development and trading consortium, including copies of the journals of Christopher Gist, who was hired by the company to negotiate terms with the Indians. William published <emph render="italic">Christopher Gist's Journals</emph> posthumously in 1893, possibly using transcriptions in this subseries. The drafts of his publication are located in the collection number dar192514. </p><p>William's <emph render="italic">Western Pennsylvania Historical Notes</emph> concerns legal events in Allegheny County, and include brief biographical notes on newly appointed judges. William also recorded information on proceedings and treaties brokered with the American Indians by early frontiersmen. Another section of this volume includes financial records concerning rent paid for several properties leased by the Darlington family. There are many loose pages within the journal and several pages are written entirely in French.

note</head><p>This subseries contains personal letters from George P. Smith and Sergeant Winthropy, and a copy of a letter William wrote from Westchester, Pennsylvania, to an unknown correspondent who had requested information on cuttings and seedlings from Guyasuta. In 1862, William wrote to his brother, John, expressing happiness that John joined an Indiana regiment instead of a Pennsylvania regiment, as Indiana regiments were less likely to be sent to war. Also present are William's membership certificates from the Academy of Natural Sciences and the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, as well as a portrait of him at the time. For more information on this topic, please refer to Box 25, which contains oversized materials. The Record-Book included in this subseries appears to contain handwritten copies of Darlington's outgoing correspondence from 1838; it also includes accounts he documented from 1840 to 1844.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref105_1cl" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sergeant Winthropy to William M.

Darlington's properties, investments, taxes and profession. Property records include a title to land in Allegheny County, an auction catalog of household goods inscribed to William, and a small notebook dated 1879 that lists bonds and mortgage payments.

Darlington used these twenty-nine diaries to make brief notes about court dates, meetings, payments he received, the purchase of stocks, and other personal and professional transactions. The diaries occasionally mention William's health and personal habits. Many of the entries involve mortgage payments he received for various properties in and around Pittsburgh. Throughout the diaries, he describes the weather at Guyasuta, and occasionally notes the height of the Allegheny River. He also briefly mentions if he had received or sent any letters. In addition, William M. Darlington writes about legal cases in which he was engaged. Social events are occasionally mentioned, including parties at the homes of Mr. Lewis Hutchinson and Mr. McKnight in 1847 and 1848. Entries in 1873/4 and 1881/2 describe the Darlington family's travels in Europe. Three undated diaries contain historical research notes, including a list of officers that served at Fort Pitt, and information on various maps and books in the Guyasuta library. Corporate and personal names mentioned in the diaries include: Allegheny Company, Penn Railroad Company, Pleasant Valley Railroad Company, Monongahela Bridge Company, John B. Herron, J. H. Fibson, John Lundy, H. Fellman, Leo Schmidt, Reverend E. McKnight, E. P. Jones, and Dr. Harrison L.

her Philadelphian grandmother, Mary Carson. Mary traced her O'Hara ancestry back to Tiege O'Hara, the last Lord of Leyney, Ireland. She studied at Edgeworth Seminary in Braddock's Field, now Braddock, Pennsylvania, and later in Staten Island at the renowned Mrs. McLeod's School. By the time she married William M. Darlington, she was a highly educated woman, well read not only in English, but Italian, German, French and Spanish. Mary and William had four children, three of whom survived into adulthood. The family resided at Guyasuta, an estate near contemporary Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, that Mary had inherited from her father, Richard O'Hara. James O'Hara purchased the property from the United States government and named it after the famous Seneca leader, Guyasuta (c.1725–c.1794), from whom the Continental Army had purchased the land. </p><p>Mary was passionate about regional history, and wrote <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic"> Fort Pitt and Letters From the Frontier</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The History of Henry Bouquet and the Western Frontiers, 1747-1746</title>, among other works. She also compiled a list of officers of the British and Revolutionary armies buried at the First Presbyterian and Trinity Churches in Pittsburgh. After the death of her husband in 1889, Mary continued expanding the collection of books and manuscripts about western Pennsylvania history. Materials in this series relate to Mary's research and writing, personal correspondence and legal and financial papers that document her vast real estate holdings. Mary compiled and collected historical documents, including Indian treaties; she also maintained records of materials loaned from the family library. Her writings, both epic and non-fiction, represented here, include a brief history of carpets, and her English language adaptation of the German <emph render="italic">Story of Nibelungen</emph>. Two copies of her lengthy manuscript <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Exiles of Erin</title> on Ireland and its noble families, are accompanied by an index listing section titles and corresponding page numbers, and a list of secondary sources that Mary used to write the work. A twenty-nine page manuscript written by Mary documents the history of the O'Hara family. </p><p>This series also contains two letters from acquaintances, William Roseburg, an investment banker from Pittsburgh, and William R. Mercer of Doylestown, Pennsylvania. A photographic print produced by Mr. Jarrett shows silhouettes of Mary as a small child with her elderly grandmother, Mary Carson O'Hara. Also present is a list of the many mortgages paid to Mary, and a list of bonds she held from companies such as the Aspinwall Delafield Company, the Pittsburgh Railway Company, the McKeesport Railway Company, the Connersville Railway Company, the Youngstown Railway Company, and the West Penn Railway Company.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref142_sug" level="file"><did><unittitle>Treaty between the Governor of Virginia and the United Nations of Tudiaus</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/15030</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1753/1753" type="inclusive">1753</unitdate><container id="aspace_6d64ec85c7d77622c5e6fb08b41427f4" label="Mixed Materials [31735077158552]" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_5517e4ba66610040ba79380b3df39810" parent="aspace_6d64ec85c7d77622c5e6fb08b41427f4" type="folder">1</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="31735051658981" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Treaty between the Governor of Virginia and the United Nations of Tudiaus" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Treaty between the Governor of Virginia and the United Nations of Tudiaus: 1753</p></daodesc></dao></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref143_b7v" level="file"><did><unittitle>School tax receipt</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/15031</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1839/1851" type="inclusive">1839-1851</unitdate><container id="aspace_3eba4423b76fd1eb73f18e5fc743a957" label="Mixed Materials [31735077158552]" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_118a22eda6bbde61146921bb07ead5d3" parent="aspace_3eba4423b76fd1eb73f18e5fc743a957" type="folder">2</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="31735051659021" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="School tax receipt" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>School tax receipt: 1839-1851</p></daodesc></dao></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref144_70y" level="file"><did><unittitle>List of maps loaned to H.

Darlington and Mary Carson O'Hara Darlington. O'Hara was an accomplished scholar in history, botany, and literature. He attended the Western University of Pennsylvania, and enrolled at Yale University with the class of 1870, where he joined the Delta Kappa Fraternity. Due to ill health, O'Hara left Yale at the end of his first year, but returned in 1871 and obtained his degree with honors. O'Hara shared his family's devotion to expanding their private library. Following his graduation from Yale, he traveled throughout Europe collecting historical artifacts and literature. O'Hara fell ill in Europe, but regained his strength. After his travels, he resided at Guyasuta. O'Hara bought and sold land in the Pittsburgh area, and ventured into the steam boat industry, investing in the transport of freight and passengers along the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers. On August 22, 1916, O'Hara died suddenly at Guyasuta from heat prostration at the age of sixty-seven following a serious illness.</p><p>O'Hara shared a passion for photography with his sister, Edith, both of whom belonged to the Pittsburgh Amateur Photographers' Society. O'Hara collected late nineteenth century British and American literature, principally fiction. Amid his collection of approximately 1,000 books are first editions of novels by Dickens and Thackeray, an early edition of Defoe's <title xlink:type="simple">Robinson Crusoe</title>, as well as a bibliography of George and Robert Cruickshank's sketches. </p><p>O'Hara's papers relate to his book collecting and historical research, including receipts from two book companies and his membership in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. His personal record-keeping is highlighted by twelve diaries, with entries concerning the weather, and the time when various flowers and trees blossom. O'Hara periodically describes the affect of droughts and heavy snowfall on his land, as well as the height of Pittsburgh's three rivers. He also includes brief notes about business meetings, court cases and property issues that concern him. The diaries also describe travel including trips to Atlantic City, New Jersey; Florida; and Chicago during the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition.</p><p>Many of the diaries contain notes of interest accrued on investments, rent and mortgage money paid or earned for the year. Additional materials relate to O'Hara's finances, include property tax receipts, notes on a legal case involving property he wished to procure, and documentation of various stocks and bonds he held. The series also contains his diploma from Yale and his obituary and funeral bill. For more information, please refer to Box 25, which contains oversized materials. </p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref157_9p9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Document summarizing court

William M. Darlington and Mary Carson O'Hara Darlington, attended the Pittsburgh School of Design and was an influential member of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Daughters of American Revolution. Mary Carson Darlington never married and continued to live at her parent's mansion 'Guyasuta' until the later years of her life. When Mary Carson Darlington and her sister, Edith Darlington Ammon, sold the property, they bought a large house in the East End of Pittsburgh. After Edith Darlington Ammon died in 1919, Mary Carson Darlington continued to live alone in their East End home until her death six years later in 1925.</p><p>Within Mary Carson Darlington's papers is tax information on her mother's estate and properties that she had inherited with her sister and older brother upon the death of their parents. Mary Carson Darlington also saved a particular book plate of George Washington given to her by her father, as she too was interested in historical preservation.

She was a well-traveled amateur photographer who played an active role in organizing and leading political and social events. </p><p>Edith grew up at Guyasuta and later studied at the Pittsburgh Female College, now known as Chatham University. After a formative trip to Europe with her family, she married Samuel Ammon in 1890, whose proposal she had previously rejected or deferred ten years earlier. Edith and Samuel had no children. </p><p>Edith served for several years as the president of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) of Allegheny County, and by 1908 she was leading the third largest DAR chapter in the United States. As president, Edith commanded the battle to preserve the Block House, one of the first structures of Fort Pitt built during the French and Indian War in 1764, from destruction by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The DAR also led a campaign against Henry Frick when he planned to relocate the Block House to present day Schenley Park. The Block House remains the oldest building in western Pennsylvania. In addition to her work with the DAR, Edith served alongside H. J. Heinz as co-vice president of the 1908 general committee for Pittsburgh's sesquicentennial events. </p><p>This series contains the many letters Edith wrote to her childhood friend and Pittsburgh Female College classmate, Mittie Hemphill, while Edith traveled with her family in Europe from 1881 to 1882. As a woman in her early twenties, Edith writes from each destination, describing the hotels where she and her family stayed, fellow guests, transit, and her experiences passing through customs. Her letters detail sightseeing, particularly art galleries and churches, and her father's research endeavors at the British Museum. Of particular note are Edith's descriptions of archaeological sites in Italy and Egypt, the <emph>Salon de Paris</emph>, and her distaste for the famous Whistler paintings on display in London. Edith collected or created souvenirs, photographs and artwork during her travels, including a framed photograph of herself at the Temple of Iris in Pompeii, Italy. Mittie's letters describe events in Pittsburgh, including the health of Edith's dogs at Guyasuta and activities of mutual acquaintances in Pittsburgh, among them Minnie Renshaw, Kate McKnight, and Edith's aunt, Helen Evans. In one letter, Mittie mentions Edith's indignation that Samuel Ammon had not waited the appropriate two month grieving period before having a party; the name of the deceased is not mentioned. </p><p>Materials related to Edith's involvement in the DAR include an article she wrote for the <title xlink:type="simple">Pittsburgh Bulletin</title>, and a letter from Thomas P. Roberts regarding the renovations to Fort Pitt co-sponsored by the Fort Pitt Society and the DAR. The collection also includes a letter from Sydney Liggett in response to Edith's request for information about the Sharp family, and a letter from Edith's husband, Samuel A. Ammon, to Mrs. Mary Echler regarding the possession of the Whitaker graveyards. Records of Edith's stocks and bonds, and two copies of a bound volume listing the properties she inherited from her mother's estate are also present.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref176_vh4"

volumes documenting local and national events. The items have been retained in their original arrangement, but lack any discernable order. Dated clippings range from late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. The majority of the items in the books are newspaper clippings from local and national newspapers and detail people, places, and items of interest in and around Pittsburgh, with a number of clippings about the Darlingtons themselves. Most are undated, though some have printed or handwritten dates on them, and lack the name of the publication. Programs, sheet music, maps, sketches appearing in newspapers, magazine clippings, obituaries, and clippings concerning areas other than Pennsylvania are also included in the scrapbooks. </p><p>Some of the books contain alphabetized indexes of the clippings and others handwritten indexes affixed to or written on the inside covers of the scrapbooks. One book contains the name of the book's binder, the date it was bound, and the cost of binding, while another has the name Mary O'Hara Darlington inscribed on the inside of the front cover.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref288_1or" level="item"><did><unittitle>Scrapbook</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/10/archival_objects/15180</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">ca. 1850s-1880s</unitdate><container id="aspace_b2d04d1cfc97eb20e06fd10557325a65" label="Mixed Materials [31735077158503]" type="box">6a</container><container id="aspace_2aa4d088feedd428440881cb8b580d9f" parent="aspace_b2d04d1cfc97eb20e06fd10557325a65" type="volume">38</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_45aa2c5453784d15ff6ca3f5c72067f4"><head>Scope and Content Notes</head><p>Inside cover signed by William M.
